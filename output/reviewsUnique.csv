Some observations:1) If the signal is fairly strong without the booster, the booster *seems* to actually slow down data transfer speeds. I don't know if it's because you're inserting one more ""relay"" between the cell tower and the wireless device, but I have tested ths scenario in various places and the results appear to be fairly consistent.2) If you are in a place with no signal or a very, very weak signal, the device will almost never help.3) The scenarios where the device works best are the ones where you have one and maybe two bars and have dropped or very poor quality calls. There is no doubt that in at least some scenarios like these, the device will improve the signal to the point where you may be able to make and keep a call.This device is not a silver bullet, but it can help in certain scenarios.","10 13, 2011",A2EMM9HWOSY2Q5,Jemmie Wang,Works in certain situations,1318464000,weBoost 3G Wireless Cellular Phone Signal Booster Kit for Vehicle - Smart Technology Amplifier Kit

One of my biggest gripes was the film coming off of the screen, and another gripe was oil and fingerprints accumulating over time.  This protector actually appears to keep those fingerprints off, giving me a clear view when watching videos.  The semigloss finish decreases the excessive glare of the native screen.Application is somewhat awkward since you apply a nonstick spray to the adhesive side and your fingers to minimize fingerprints.  There is a rubber squegy that decreases the 'bubbles' and uneven application of the cover.The tactile feel still allows good sensitivity of the touch screen.A lifetime warranty is somewhat of an oxymoron, given that the phone will likely be replaced in 2-3 years by its user.This is one of the best screen protectors that I have had the chance to use.","06 21, 2009",AGGAQLXPVGM5D,Eagle Vision,Great protection,1245542400,invisibleSHIELD for the Apple iPhone 3G (Back)

The first one became extremely hot when charged with the 12V adapter plug & wouldn't hold a charge for over a few hours., I suspect that the truck voltage(14.1V) is too much for this little battery. I haven't tried the auxiliary truck plug on this one as I don't want to fry the battery. The AC power brick has a rated output of 9V so I suspect the 5V difference is what does in the battery. This one I have only used the AC adapter & the battery life is at best abysmal. The info supplied claims a standby life of up to 100 hours & talk time of up to 6 hours. Not even close. Yesterday my unit ran 6 hours standby & 1 hour talk before it had to be recharged. If this unit lived up to it hype I would give it 5 stars, but with its poor battery life I only give it 2.

So far, I really don't have any complaints.  The sound quality is very nice; much better than open-ear styles, pairs easily with my PC, G1, PS3, and my Vtech home phone.  Using it for phone calls is average, but very acceptable.  Blocks out a lot of noise naturally and can even use them while mowing the grass without cranking the volume all the way up to hear it over the mower.  Range varies depending on whether you're using it to talk on the phone or listening to music; I get a good 20 feet for music (little or no obstructions) and about 30 feet using for phone (couple of rooms away) for telephone.For me, I've found the perfect pair of wireless headphones.

1026,B0019UX796,"[1, 1]",2,"1.  I'm on my third pair of these headphones;  thankfully i only purchased them once, but Sennheiser has been a solid company and as sent me two brand new units.2.  Bottomline, these headphones are great sounding wireless / bluetooth headphones, they fit well (at least my head) and are easy to operate.  However, as with all wireless headphones, they are overtly inferior to the traditional wired headphones in terms of sound quality and volume (huge issue with me).  Furthermore, compared to the ""BT"" wireless line in Sennheiser, this unit is overtly inferior in terms of sound and especially build quality.  So getting to my main point (sorry for taking so long), all in all a nice pair of wireless phones (ie you should have a specific purpose for a wireless set over a traditional wired set).  The problem with this specific line is that they're poorly made.  The on / off button is... lame.  Specifically, it's difficult to tell if you're pressing down on the button properly.  Ok, so what one may say and I agree.  Clarifying statement in terms of the poorly made:  I have send back two units because one unit would not turn off (I tried every trick in the book, but the button was stuck or something else was going on)  The other unit wouldn't turn on consistently.  There would be days where it would work properly and then other days when the darn thing wouldn't powerup (yes, the headphones were fully fully charged).3.  Thus, unless you specifically require this type / shape of headphones (which I do), then I would strongly recommend going with the higher priced but definitely much better Sennheiser wireless phones (ex: the BT line, which are truely 5 star products).4.  On a side note: Kudos to Sennheiser for being a 5 star company;  no questions asked, no hassles, they're a company that stands behind their products and puts out excellent stuff... most of the time.","01 6, 2012",APBB297H3ZA5E,Harry M.

1243,B001GRRVBC,"[2, 3]",5,"This comes with both the Innocase II and the holster. The Innocase II is slim and adds very little to the size of the iPhone. It does not have a tacky feel at all and does not attract lint, but instead has a smooth, almost sensual feel, while still providing a good grip. I need to have my phone on my belt, but it would slide easily in and out of your pocket. It fits the phone perfectly and is tight enough that it has to be pushed on and is a little difficult to get off, so there's no worry about it coming off unless you want it to. It leaves the controls easy to reach and use, but protects them well enough that if you drop it, it would have to land at an angle on the controls to damage them. Not impossible, but it would have to land just right. It is also lined with a velvety material so it won't scratch your phone. I also like that it covers the silver bezel on the front of the phone. I'm sure some prefer to see it, but this case also protects that part. There is another brand that leaves that part exposed if you prefer that. With this case on, it's beautifully black sleek and sexy, like a beautiful woman wearing a little black dress.I haven't had any problems with the clips on the bottom portion, but I've only removed it about 3 times.The holster and Innocase were designed to work together and they do so perfectly. The Innocase clips easily and securely to the holster. It is also quick and easy to release when you want to use the phone. The Innocase goes into the holster with the screen facing the holster, so only the back of the case is exposed and the holster is also lined with the same material as the inside of the Innocase to protect the screen. Also, when you release the phone, it comes out in your hand in the right position for use, without having to maneuver, or turn the phone.I've never had a holster case before because I just didn't trust them, but bought this one based on the reviews and I'm glad I did. I've tried pulling the phone out of the holster and have been unable to get the phone to release from the holster unless I lift the catch. The belt clip has a hook at the bottom that attaches securely to my belt and is even a little difficult to pull off. It fits my heavy 1 1/2"" belt with no problem, but probably won't fit a belt much wider than that.The only problem I've had, if you can call it that, is that when the iPhone with the Innocase II is in the holster and on my belt, it's all so slim and light that I have to keep checking to make sure it's still there.If anything happens to this case I will definitely replace it and am thinking of getting another Innocase in a different color, just to have a spare.","07 8, 2009",A2E6R5K2VZ0N5Q,Amazon Customer,Great Case,1247011200,"Seidio Innocase II Surface Spring Clip Holster Combo for iPhone 3G, 3GS (Black)"

I then tried a not retractable cable that was pretty thick and the static was gone and the sound was a lot better. You have to sacrifice sound for clutter free cables or go with sound and have wires all over. I stopped using this since I couldn't stand the static.

Unit came pre-charged but follow instructions... charge it for a minute or so before use. After that, it's as simple as plug it in. Fast charged my HTC EVO 4G from almost empty to full in a very short time... sorry forgot to time the charging time because I was overly excited over this new toy. After that I charged it using an AC-USB charger until all 5 green LED's are lit. Concept: Neat and Concise. The battery extender could also be charged by a computer via its USB cable. Then the same USB cable could be flipped over to charge the phone; in my case, I had to use an additional mini USB to micro USB charging adapter. So 1 cable, 1 bat-ext, 1 adapter, all in a single pouch. A+ for compact. A+ for simplicity and nice touch on the little status button that tells you how much juice is left. Industrial Design: Clean line and 'Apple' like although the enclosure squeaks a little when it's being squeeze. And because of the shining effect, expect fingerprints magnet! Buff the prints off using the soft case, and it looks marvelous! Overall, well built and no gap, which show excellent workmanship and attention to details. Markings are sharp and no blemish found. Don't know about how safe it is as there is no UL Listing Mark on it; could be a concern for a rechargeable Li-Ion battery, which is known to go 'Kaboom' when being over-charged. Has some weight feel to it...feel like it's stocky! Good, I am expecting beefy juice out of this bad boy!Since it's full charge 8 days ago, it now has lost one green LED without being used. Assuming that the unit discharges linearly, it would take 8*5=40 days to completely discharge... Recognizing that this a false assumption and theoretically at best, so don't go jumping all over me now! I will give the unit another 8 days to check if it would lose another LED. Then loading and cycling tests of the unit will begin. Stay tune.Update Jan 2013 - After 2 years of using this device, it has paid for itself many times over. The battery appears to reach it's life cycle so I have to charge it more often to ensure I have backup power while traveling. It's still a nice unit when it was introduced at the time... simple to use, just remember to plug it in the night before your trip to have a full charge ready for use.... today there are many similar options to choose from other companies, and there are newer models from the same company... worth a second look.","12 7, 2010",A2L6I0ZLGKO2ND,"Tinkeringeek ""Tinkeringeek""",Very Neat Little Power Brick,1291680000,"Satechi iCel 5200 mAh (2 amp) Battery Extender Pack and Charger for iPhone 6, 5, 5S, 5C, 4, HTC One, Nexus 5, DROID, Samsung Galaxy S4, S5, S6, S6 Edge, Note 3, 2, Flip & Vado HD Camcorders"

My primary aim for this device is usage of chat software(IM+), emails and internet browsing (Opera Mini). This is by far is one of the best and user friendly devices I have used. It is not laggy as windows mobile devices, The menus can be accessed quickly with no delays. And especially multitasking (which iphone lacks) is a very nice feature that has been helping me a lot while chatting, making a phone call, and watching a video or listening to the music at the same time. Of course I had to update it with the latest firmware update. Before that, I had some java errors and spontaneous reboots, but not anymore. Since the last update I can confirm that I had NO problems whatsoever. I have few complaints though which in my opinion are minor ones and I can live with them. First is the battery life. If I am not using internet very often it may last a day and a half but when I am browsing with Opera Mini or chatting on IM+ the battery drains very quickly so I have to carry another battery with me. Another thing I would prefer to have is a nice youtube player which I can't find anywhere (I tryed a couple of them). And the youtube that plays with a native browser is just garbage, which is kind of sad because other phones like Iphone and HTC touch pro 2 can play youtube quite nicely. And last but not least is the camera. Outdoors, on the bright light you can get more or less decent pictures but if you will try to shoot a video it will come out as a total crap, pixelated with distorted lighting. And the flash isn't helping much either. Unlike for example with Nokia n97 which takes pretty decent pictures and videos. But like I said these things are minor ones and since this phone is being oriented more for a business user you can't expect to have it all. Especially I like the ability to operate this device with one hand only, which comes in handy in many situations, unlike some other phones with larger keyboards I have tried. Of course another nice feature is a multilanguage support which you can not have in windows mobile phones (e.g. convert device and keyboard interface in spanish, german or other language at no charge) Now I am only expecting the release of OS 5.0 which I will immediately install on my device. So let's see how that goes. I definitely recommend Blackberry Bold for someone who is searching for a device with push email, chatting and light internet use.","10 28, 2009",A27XZ2EQ8VUT7Y,AAlt,Great device!,1256688000,RIM Blackberry Bold 9000 (Unlocked) - BLACK

It would have taken me three times as long to get near the same results.This is how he did it: He thoroughly cleaned my iPhone with a cleaning solution and a clothe, getting rid of all the smudges and specks of dust. Then he took out and handled one of the films with two fingers, one each on the vertical sides of the film. He then lined up the two holes in the film (one for the speaker and one for the home button) and he carefully let the film affix to the glass. When he spotted a tiny bubble, he slightly pulled up the film and reset it again. He used the clothe to further affix the film to the glass.The trick was to make sure there were no smudges or specks of dust on the glass. Clean it thoroughly.Needless to say, the film does not have the same smooth feel as the glass. You'll have to get used to the difference. And though the film requires less cleaning and doesn't get as much smudges as the glass, it still requires cleaning.The film fits the class very nicely, and there's not too much difference in the overall viewing of video or images on the iPhone. I would prefer not to use the film, but I just found myself always wiping away annoying smudges from the glass.","04 11, 2009",A2J0IBS4PFRO2C,Bakari Chavanu,Good product; tricky to put on,1239408000,Power Support Anti-Glare Film Set for iPhone (Original)

A summary:Pros:-paired very easily-call quality coming in and going out is excellent and works well with voice dialing (and voice commands on my iPhone).- great for listening to podcasts just using the single headset (without extra earpiece) since they are already monaural.- good for listening to music with the second earpiece attached.-controls my phone and ipod functions very well. I can pause and resume what I was listening to on my  iphone anytime.cons:-Sometimes misses a second of music (doesn't happen with calls at all).- Stereo sound quality is good but not fantastic.  Since I listen mostly to podcasts and audiobooks, it doesn't make any difference and when I listen to music, it is good enough for me.- the connector for charging is micro usb.  My first 855 had a problem with the connector loosening so it would reliably charge. Plantronic promptly replaced it.

495,B000HBIUNG,"[69, 90]",3,"I purchased the 655 after reading a glowing review on cnet.  I had read a lot of reviews on multiple sites that indicated that a lot of bluetooth headsets didn't provide a clear signal.  Based on the cnet review I assumed the 655 was different.This being my first bluetooth headset, I'm not exactly sure what the standard is.  However, the Plantronics literature for this model clearly states that users will have ""33 feet to roam.""  In my experience, using a Blackberry 8700g, this is just false.  I get a clear signal 8 to 10 feet away from my phone.  After that the static kicks in and and increases dramatically as the distance increases.  Maybe Plantronics is just copying the hyperbole of other manufactuers.  Nonetheless,I'm not sure if I would have purchased this model if I had known that I was limited to 10 feet at most.With that said, I do find that reception is very clear within the 8 foot range.  Also, the volume control is excellent.  I found it easier to hear voices with the 955 than anything I'd experienced with a dozen corded headsets.The accessories are probably the biggest selling point.  The 955 comes with three earpieces and can be recharged via a AAA battery, USB or with a provided electrical adapter.If you're looking for a bluetooth set that provides clear reception beyond 10 feet (like they claim they're supposed to) then I wish you luck.  As of late 2006, based on reviews I've read, I wasn't able to find a single headset that gave that kind of reception.

And that little keyboard lites up in bright blue and white is very easy to read.

I figure that if you consider spending several hundred dollars on a phone, the more information the better. :)The first thing to get straight about this phone is that it is not about form, but function.  It is not the slimmest or sexiest phone out there, nor does it have the most awe-inspiring user interface compared to the likes of the iPhone.  On the other hand, it has every capability that you will find on any phone these days:* A 5MP camera with autofocus, LED flash, and VGA video recording, Carl Zeiss lens, and a 1/2.5"" CCD (same as in most compact digital cameras).  Various shooting modes (macro, night, night portrait, sports, etc...), ISO control, flash control w/red-eye reduction.  Immediately send pictures via bluetooth, email, MMS, etc.* GPS with Nokia Maps application and optional voice navigation.  Various third party applications (e.g. Google Maps for S60) support its built-in GPS as well.* 3.5G (HSDPA) connectivity (see note about models below), This gives clearer voice and much faster data downloads (theoretically up to 3.5 Mbps; in practice I have seen from 900 Kbps to about 2.2 Mbps, depending on location and time of day).* WiFi (802.11g) with WEP, WPA/WPA2, and EAP/802.1x authentication (for corporate environments)* Support for nearly every Bluetooh profile in existence: A2DP for stereo audio, DUN for tethering the phone's internet connection with a laptop (for on-the road use), OBEX to send/receive files and browse the internal filesystem from a computer.* 3.5mm headset jack, infrared port w/send/receive utility, FM tuner.* ""Dual slider"" design: Slide display up to reveal numeric keypad; and down to reveal four multimedia buttons (Play/Pause, stop, rewind, fast forward).  Sliding it down also changes the display orientation from portrait to landscape; sliding it up switches it back.* Symbian S60 smartphone OS: In addition to thousands of available generic Java (J2ME) mobile applications, there are also nearly an equal number of native applications that can access additional functionality/hardware on the phone (for instance, there is one that uses the built-in accelerometer to control your computer's mouse cursor by simply tilting the phone, and another one that uses the built-in GPS to ""geotag"" pictures with your location as you use the camera).* Built-in applictions include QuickOffice to read Microsoft Office files (DOC, PPT, XLS), Adobe Acrobat Lite reader (PDF), RealPlayer (most media files/streams), home screen ""Search"" applet to search the Internet and local content, various organizer apps (clock w/unlimited alarms, phonebook with unlimited entries, calendar w/unlimited meetings, todos, memos, reminders..), calculator, unit converter -- you get the picture.  Notably absent, though, is a Timer/Stopwatch application; however you can easily download a third party one (e.g. from Smartphoneware).* Other S60-specific applications include Nokia's Internet Radio to stream live radio streams, ""RotateMe"" to automatically rotate the screen depending on your phone orientation, ""Fring"" mobile Skype/AIM/MSN/Google Talk/etc.. client, Google Maps with GPS support, Google home screen search applet, Mobile Weather app, ""ExtGPS"" to share the internal GPS information over bluetooth (e.g. to theNokia N800 Internet Tablet), YouTube player, emTube (also for YouTube access), etc.* One of the best mobile web browsers out there.  Based on AppleWebKit (a.k.a. KTML, the web engine used in the likes of Apple Safari and KDE Konqueror), it renders web pages ""as they were meant to be"".  And unlike that other phone that claims to do the same, the N95 also has a built-in Flash Lite player - so web pages that use flash will work as well.  Plus, you are of course free to download and use other browsers, such as the excellent, super-fast and bandwidth-saving Opera Mini (operamini.com).* Mail client with POP-3 and IMAP support (including IMAP-IDLE, a.k.a. ""push mail""; alternatively it can poll at specified intervals).* Mac OS X users: Although the phone does not come with bundled software for Mac OS X, you can download ""Nokia Multimedia Transfer"" (to synchronize photos and music with iPhoto and iTunes) and an iSync plugin (to synchronize the address book, calendar, todo etc) with your Mac - both from Nokia's web site.  Also, setting up your Mac to access the Internet via the phone (providing that you have a data plan, e.g. the $15/month ""MEdia Net Unlimited"" from AT&T;) is super-easy: When you first pair with the phone, the needed WAP/APN information is pulled automatically from your Phone's SIM card.  (Ironically, this works for nearly every phone, except Apple's own iPhone; this one has a very crippled bluetooth stack, and does also not support tethering).  UPDATE: I've learned that such tethering violates AT&T;'s Terms of Service.  Moreover, there are no  plans available for this phone (or most others) from AT&T; that specifically allow tethering.  If you do so anyway, stay under the radar, and don't abuse it - e.g. by using your cellular data plan as your main internet service.MODELS:=======There are 5 subflavors of the N95 released to date:* The original N95 (a.k.a. N95-1, a.k.a. RM-159) targeted mainly the European and Asian markets; while it had quad-band GSM (2G) support for use in nearly every country, including the USA, it had support only for the international W-CDMA (UMTS/HSDPA, a.k.a. 3G/3.5G) frequency (commonly referred to as UMTS-2100).  Nonetheless, this phone was later made available for retail in the USA as well, through Nokia's flagship stores, online site, and 3rd party retailers.  It had manual shutter lens protection (you would slide it open to start the camera), 64MB of runtime/dynamic memory (RAM), and a 900 mAh battery.  Common complaints about this phone was that it would often run out of memory when several applications were open, and that the battery life was too short.* The N95-2 (a.k.a. ""N95 8GB"", a.k.a. RM-320) increased the screen size from 2.6"" to 2.8"" (diagonal), increased RAM from 64MB to 128MB, increased the battery size from 900 mAh to 1200 mAh, removed the slider mechanism for opening the camera lens, replaced the SDHC card slot with 8GB of internal flash, and replaced the silver faceplate with an all-black design.  However, the bands supported were the same: W-CDMA 2100MHz, GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz - so although it will work fine with both AT&T; Wireless, T-Mobile USA and Rogers, it does not support 3G/3.5G network speeds in North America.  Nonetheless, as with the N95-1, Nokia has sold this phone in North America as well until just a few weeks ago; so possibly, this is the phone sold here (Unfortunately, Nokia's own sales channels do not normally make this distinction, and Amazon's product description is also somewhat lacking).  UPDATE: As the product description now clearly says, this is the N95-4 (a.k.a. N95 8GB NAM) model.* The N95-3 (a.k.a. ""N95 NAM"", RM-160) is the first model targeted for North America.  Most of the exterior design is similar to the N95-1 (Silver faceplate, 2.6"" screen, SDHC slot), but like the N95-2, it has 128MB of RAM, a 1200 mAh battery, and no manual slider for the camera shutter.  The main reason for its existence is that it swapped the original UMTS-2100 (WCDMA) frequency for UMTS-850 and UMTS-1900, so that it would work with AT&T; Wireless's 3G/3.5G network.  Until just a few days/weeks ago, this would have been the ""best"" choice for US customers.* The N95-4 (a.k.a. ""N95 8GB NAM"", RM-421) is identical to the N95-2, except that like the N95-3, it swaps UMTS-2100 for UMTS-850/1900.  It was released just a couple of weeks ago, though, so if Amazon got their inventory of ""n95 8gb"" devices from Nokia prior to this, it would have been the N95-2 rather than the N95-4.  (The exterior and labeling of both is the same).  Also, the firmware revision numbers are different, so some utilities (like the ""Nokia Multimedia Transfer"" application and iSync plugin for Mac OS X) do not yet recognize this phone. UPDATE: The N95-4 is now fully supported by most applications, including Nokia Multimeda Transfer and iSync plugin.* The N95-5 is for Japan; it is a stripped-down version of the N95-1 (e.g. no WiFi). UPDATE: As someone commented below, it is actually for China.COMPARED WITH OTHER PHONES:==========================N95 vs. iPhone==============This is almost an irrational comparison, given how different these devices are:* The iPhone is almost entirely about ""sex appeal"": Polished, slim, with a large screen for viewing content, multi-touch user interface (we've all seen how to zoom in and out using finger pinches, do inertial scrolling through a list of contacts, etc).  As such, it is very big on ""usability"".  The N95 is not even a touch-screen device.  (Personally I actually prefer ""hard"" keys w/tactile feedback; having used the touch-screen based Motorola A1200 MING in the past.  Touch screens are not very good for, for example, dialing a number without looking at the screen).* The iPhone feature set is, at best, mediocre.  Yes, it has WiFi - so does a lot of other phones.  Yes, it has a ""WYSIWYG"" web browser; again, so do so many others (including the 3-year oldMotorola A1200 MING, another touch-screen phone by the way).  However, it lacks: 3G support, GPS, Infrared, FM Radio, decent camera functionality (no flash, video recording, etc), 3rd party application support (e.g. no Internet Radio, GPS navigation, etc), or even a usable Bluetooth stack (to do silly little things like transfer files or enable internet access for a nearby laptop while on the road).  Even the otherwise crappy Motorola RAZR line (e.g. RAZR v3xx) do most of these things. UPDATE: With the release of the iPhone 3G and the new App Store, Apple has come a long way.  It's worth pointing out though that the iPhone can still not run standard J2ME/MIDP mobile applications, only those released specifically for the iPhone through the App store.  Per the Apple Terms of Service, this means: No 3rd party web browser (e.g. Opera Mini), no voice navigation, not even something along the lines of Nokia Sports Tracker (since it uses the GPS).* The iPhone is only available with a 2-year contract from AT&T; the N95 is only available SIM-free (unlocked).In short: The iPhone is about form, the N95 (and Symbian devices in general) about function.N95 vs.Sony Ericsson K850i===========================These are the only two 5MP camera phones available for the US market.  Neither of them is offered by a carrier (AT&T;, T-Mobile, Cellular One, Rogers...), so in both cases you will pay the full price for the phone.  (The upside, of course, is that you will not need to renew your contract to get it.. :)Also, both phones (in the case of the N95, some flavors of it) support the U.S. 3G bands, in addition to being quad-band GSM phones.  The difference here is that the k850i supports all four GSM bands and all three UMTS bands at the same time, so you don't have to pick a ""US"" vs. ""International"" flavor.  Finally, both phones have built-in FM tuners - though the k850i also supports RDM to display programming information transmitted in the broadcast.Most comparisons of these phones therefore center around the camera functionality (e.g. PhoneArena.com, GSMArena.com, and Mobile-Review.Com all have head-to-head comparison reviews of the two).  In summary: As far as camera phones go, these are as good as you get; they are both comparable to mid-range pocket cameras.  The k850i has an advantage indoors, because it has a real Xenon flash in addition to the LED autofocus assist beam.  However, in general, it has more ""washed out"" color reproduction than the more vivid N95; and it only supports video recording in QVGA (320x240) resolution compared to the N95 VGA (640x480).The main difference between the phones lie in other areas. The N95 is a Symbian smartphone, and so can run a whole slew of native applications specifically written for this platform, while the k850i is limited to running generic Java (j2me) mobile applictions.  Also, the k850i does not have a built-in GPS (but using an external bluetooth GPS receiver together with free GPS navigation software such as AmazeGPS, you can get voice navigation on this phone as well).  The Java version of Google Maps (which is what you would use on the k850i) has a ""My Location"" feature that uses information from cell phone towers to pinpoint ROUGHLY where you are, within a couple of miles; similar to the iPhone.  Various other limits exist in the k850i as well (1000 phonebook entries, 5 alarms, etc..)On the other hand, the k850i does have a few built-in applications that are notably absent from the N95: A flashlight application (uses the LED autofocus beam), mouse/keyboard emulation to control your bluetooth-enabled computer (e.g. for presentation), and a stopwatch/timer app.One last thing to note about the K850i:  Although it uniquely supports both U.S. and International 3G frequencies, its use on the AT&T; wireless network is sub-optimal.  That's because there is an interoperability issue with its built-in media player and the MEdiaNet configuration - so streaming internet videos (e.g. from YouTube) does not work.  This was the single most important reason why I ended up returning my k850i to the local store where I bought it, after having had it for about 2 weeks.N95 vs. the Samsung G810========================The Samsung G810 was announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February; it is another Symbian S60 phone with a feature set almost identical to the N95.  It will be sold internationally starting this fall; probably not in the U.S. though -- it is lacking the GSM 850 MHz frequency used here. (In other words, it is only a ""tri-band"" phone).  Maybe they plan on releasing a US version as well - I guess that depends on whether a carrier picks it up or not.Other than that, for better or worse the G810 has a 3x optical zoom. ""Worse"" because that inevitably leads to compromises in the optics (the thickness of the phone is the same, so that must mean that the CCD sensor is smaller - meaning more noise).  On the upside, it does have Xenon flash and a protective lens cap.Early available specs also indicate that it will have 96MB of RAM - midway between the N95-1 and subsequent N95s; however, the RAM will be split up into a 32MB chunk for the DSP (GSM and W-CDMA radios) and 64MB for the Symbian phone OS/functionality.  Thus, this could become an issue.For now, anther Samsung, the G600, although not available for sale in the US, seems to have a better camera (in some reviews outperforming the N95 and k850i), as well as quad-band GSM support.  (It is otherwise a low-end phone though, without e.g. 3G).UPDATE: Other Nokia Phones==========================Since the N95, several other N-series and E-series phones have been released by Nokia with very similar feature sets.  For instance, the N82, which features a full Xenon flash, and thus doubles nicely as a pocket camera also for indoor use (though the only version available does not support North American 3G bands, just like the N95-1 and N95-2).UPDATE Dec 1, 2008: The N95 now has a couple of worthy successors, each of which improve on its feature set in different ways: TheN85and theN96.  Personally, I'll stick to the N95 8GB though (see my N85 review to see why).","04 3, 2008",AU5V90NU1ON6O,Tor Slettnes,The perfect geek phone,1207180800,"Nokia N95-4 8 GB Unlocked Phone with 5 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, and Media Player--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)"

Every time I use them I have to spend five to ten minutes just trying to get the headphones into pairing mode and to actually pair with the host device. Motorola used the horrible ""one button does it all"" interface for operating power and pairing, even though there are two buttons on the headset.* The other button on the other side of the headset is useless because it's proprietary.  It's supposed to pause/play music but it doesn't work with any device I've ever paired the headphones with.* The little rubber flap that covers the USB and audio input plugs is always falling out and hanging lopsided.* The headphones say on the package and in adverts that you can connect a headphone cable to another device to listen instead of using Bluetooth, but they don't tell you that the cable has to be Motorola's ""special"" headphone cable, which you have to order from Motorola.  You can't just go to the store and buy a iPod headphone cable to use with the headphones like you can with most other devices.*The fabric on the inside of the headband is nice for keeping your head from sweating but it causes carpet burns on the back of your neck if you wear the headphones around your neck.*Not recommended for DJs (trust me, I am one) because you can never be sure how long the battery is going to last, as there's no battery meter. You really don't want your headphones to quit on you in the middle of a live show.* When the batteries get low there's a series of three beeps then an ear-bursting *POP* noise.  I wrote to Motorola to complain and ask if the issue could be fixed, but they responded by sending me another set of the same headphones which had the same problem. The only workaround is to quickly jerk the headphones off of your head when you hear the three beeps to avoid hurting your ears with the loud pop noise.* There's a really bright LED light that fades on and off while the headphones are receiving audio that you can't disable, on each side of the headphones.  It's kind of neat for about the first five minutes then it gets annoying.* The minimum volume is still sometimes too loud.* Default volume at power on is always too loud.","06 5, 2008",A7829CRHD25WU,"Majik ""FTW""",Good Sound Difficult to Operate,1212624000,Motorola S805 Bluetooth D.J.

They have paired easily with every device I've tried, and even work very well as a hands free headset for a bluetooth cell phone. However, they don't work with my Mac, and contrary to the insinuation by the other reviewer, this is in no way Jabra's fault. Bluetooth is bluetooth, and it's up to the computer manufacturer to support the ""profiles"" supported by various devices. In the case of the Mac, Apple's Bluetooth support is incomplete; they don't handle the advanced audio profile required for stereo headsets, and so this headset (or ANY other stereo bluetooth headset, for that matter) will not work with a Mac until Apple decides to fix this. This is completely out of Jabra's control, and this is a very well engineered device. If you own a Window's XP computer, this will work very well.The only negative I can find is that the headset is not adjustable and thus may not fit everybody comfortably.

737,B000XT3L7W,"[2, 2]",5,"I bought this for a specific purpose, not it's primary intended purpose.I bought it to use on my motorcycle for the voice instructions from a TomTom GO 720 GPS. I really like the GPS, and use it a lot in my car, but its output options for audio on a motorcycle are really limited. It does do bluetooth, but only to a device that self identifies as a 'HiFI stereo device'. Helmet-ready 'HiFi stereo' kit is seriously expensive, given the need for sound isolation (=earplugs). The Jabra BT3030 works perfectly for this application. The supplied earphones provide sufficient ear-plug effect, and are comfortable for long periods (hours) under a helmet. They also provide good quality stereo sound. For me, for this application, this is an excellent, sensibly priced solution.The Jabra is also an excellent handsfree phone headset, and also is excellent at playing music stored on my phone's SD card, and though I never felt the need for either of those functions before, having tried it, I shall be using it for both.The only 'problem' is that all three devices are 'too smart' for me to be able to use all three functions at the same time. All three devices can connect to two other devices simultaneously; the phone to the headset and the GPS; the GPS to the phone and the headset; and the headset to the phone and the GPS. And all have logic allowing a signal on one input to intelligently overide the signal on the other input. So if I connect them all at once, the GPS gives me navigation directions, which the headset picks up, but the phone also detects the directions, decides that they need to be passed on to the headset (since the phone is not 'in use') and repeats them about a quarter second later to the headset, The headset starts relaying the instruction from the GPS, then gets the instructions from the phone, decides a message from the phone overides an (assumed) 'music input', and overides the GPS instruction with the same instruction a quarter second later from the phone, but only during the actual words, it flip-flops back to the other signal in the silences between words! The result is what I can only describe as a 'stuttering echo' or an 'echoing stutter' :DSince I don't want to talk on the phone while I'm riding, I just switch off the phone while riding, and switch off the GPS and switch on the phone when I stop riding. Works for me. :)If you wanted to do all three at once, I'm not sure even the expensive gear could solve that problem...","09 11, 2009",A2I4LS3L2EFG3J,Brian Henderson,Excellent for a sensible price,1252627200,Jabra BT3030 Bluetooth Stereo Headset (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

Most of them are pretty standard to cell phones these days, but a few things are worth commenting on:-Great speakerphone.  Very loud and clear sounding, both ways.-Decent battery life.  Almost lasts a week with minimal usage; 2 days with heavier use.-Battery meter is very inaccurate below 1/2 charge.  Seems chronic with Motorola phones.-Nice, clear display.  A bit hard to see in the brightest sunlight, but other than that, no problems.-Camera is of average quality at best.  Takes okay pictures for a new wallpaper, but that's about it.-Serious annoyance: One of the side buttons that remain exposed when the phone is closed controls the type of ring/vibrate.  It's very loud if you don't already have the phone on silent/vibrate only.  Basically, to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent--say in a theater--you have to make a loud noise.  Very short sighted.  And since the button is exposed even with the phone closed, you end up hitting it by accident quite a bit.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the phone.

This is the closest I've come so far.Here's the good:===========================* By far, the best thing about it is the noise-cancelling feature. I'm on the road a lot, and the ""max"" setting almost eliminates road and background noise on the other end...my daughter said she hated talking to me when I was on the road before I bought this headset. This is a MAJOR plus, and the main reason I bought it to begin with. It simply works!* Volume is LOUD! In those noisy environments, this is a plus, and I usually have to turn it down to mid-range, even in noisy areas.* Unlike some, it is very comfortable to me, for long periods of time, and I wear mine for hours at a time. Lighweight and small...compared to my Motorola H700, it's heaven. I forget it's even on sometimes.* I love the quick disconnect, reconnect feature using the volume up/down buttons.  I use it with two phones (Motorola V325 for work and Blackberry 8700c for personal), and this makes it a breeze to switch from one to the other without having to fumble through the phone menus. (If you use it with a Blackberry, be sure to turn off the ""Echo Control"" setting in the BT menu for this headset.)* Clip for your shirt or pocket.* The price is very reasonable for a headset with these advanced features.So, what kept it from being 5-stars?=====================================* Proprietary charger (why not mini-USB, except to make more money?)* Slippery plastic ear hook, though they do include extras.* Talk time is okay, but not great. I can get maybe 4-5 hours out of it, putting it squarely in the average range based on my experiences.But these are minor, nitpicking complaints.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who wants a small, lightweight, comfortable, noise-reducing headset.","03 11, 2008",A38FPHYE72Y25P,bigbluelou,Best BT Headset I've used so far...and I've used a LOT,1205193600,BlueAnt Z9 Bluetooth Headset with Voice Isolation Technology

When I put my phone on the dock I switch it to the clock mode so the dock makes my phone an alarm clock at nite and keeps my phone in a convenient, safe place. The only bad comment I have to say about it is that it will not fit if you have a case-mate cover over your phone. It is just the right size for just my phone. I'm not sure if a thinner case will do the trick but it is annoying having to take the case off everyday before bed and putting it back on in the mornings.
