6073894996,"[1, 1]",2,"I could only give this USB car charger 2 stars because although it worked fine for about 3 months, it subsequently died on me.Pros:-Has 2 USB ports for charging, one (the top) is 2.1 amps.  The bottom slot is lower, presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.","06 25, 2012",A5A4374R8I7NB,PWB Esq,"Works Fine, But It Died On ME",1340582400,"SANOXY High Output Dual USB Port Car Charger for Ipad, Samsung Galaxy, Iphone, Blackberry, Droid, Gps, and Other Tablets, Smart Phones and High Powered Devices"

B000056PYW,"[13, 14]",3,"Jabra makes, by far the best hands-free devices on the market.  This particular model, the EarBoom, is not with it's faults.  However, it will meet your needs for the most part if you figure out it's peculiarities.Jabra provides multiple ear gels for comfort and for left ear or right ear use.  The criticism that they are hard to get used to is valid.  You have to try putting them in different ways till you figure it out.  The instructions are not a substitute for trial and error I suppose.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack.  That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by.  Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine, despite the short arm.  If you find people are telling you your voice is muffled, you must slighly twist the microphone head.  I have found that sometimes, if it is at the wrong angle, it will not capture sound as well.  The arm is flexible enough that it can be adjusted slightly.I also prefer the EarWave Boom or the EarWrap, which have wraparound ear attachments and a slightly longer more solid arm.  The Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie.  Personally I don't like those models.  I have not found much difference in sound quality, though the EarWave Boom and the EarWrap are somehow easier to figure out.For difficulty of use and for a microphone arm style that I just don't like, I have docked this unit 2 stars.  It should be noted that none of Jabra's newer models have this microphone arm any longer  But this is good bang for the buck.  Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.","02 4, 2005",A17BUUBOU0598B,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""",A good unit at a great price.

One is easy to open but the other sticks so it requires some extra force to open. The latches are apparently designed to be removable so I was able to just slide it back in place but since it is so hard to unlatch I have pulled it totally off on three occasions now. I could just glue it in place but the fact that it is removable makes me wonder if the manufacturer is planning on it breaking eventually. Why else would it be designed so it can be easily removed?The second problem I had came after flying with it. There is no pressure release valve on it and after getting to my hotel I attempted to open this case and could not.

They are charging me $35 (expected) plus $11.53 in taxes, fees and assessments &quot;we can't change&quot; for a couple of days when all I called was customer service.If you buy the phone, I hope Nextel has a local area code for you, because if they don't you are stuck for $46.53 and an Amazon return.

I've had a couple weeks to try out mine, and the battery life with my usage is 3-4 days, and I use the phone for short calls about 5 times a day.  The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much).  I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel.  It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt.  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost.  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc.  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav.  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great.  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them.  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect.  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it.  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with.  This phone is full featured, it isn't exactly a PDA phone, but it's software capability and 65k color screen make it perform many of the same functions as a PDA.

I have many friends who own this phone though, although a few of them have since ""downgraded"" to the i710.The main reason I chose the i710 over this i730 was signal strength. the i710 consistently gets better signal the the i730 no matter which of my friends phones I compare it too. All my friends are on the same wireless plan from Nextel as I am, so I know its not service, it is definitely the phones.I can have full bars on my phone (5 including the little antennae icon) and my friends phone held right next to mine will have 2 or 3 bars. My phone gets signal in places their phones are ""Out of Service.""Now you might say that maybe my friend just has a dud phone. Well I have 4 friends who have the i730, 5 friends with the i710 and one with the i860, all from Nextel, and the i710's always have better signal compared to the i730's. The i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too).I am not sure why two phones based on the same hardware and software have such drastic differences in signal. The only thing I can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow.Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone. Lots of features, solid and durable construction and good battery life. For me signal was more important that a silver case an an external screen but if you like those things the i730 is a decent phone to use.","04 15, 2005",AGZ8HQO485IL8,J.

(another story altogether) However, my cranky old Samsung (a generation prior to e415) used to last 2 full days on an extended battery with same or greater amt of use.2) Familiar problem - phone's earpiece is too quiet.3) Software's pure crap - the phonebook is not only not intuitive, it would save phone numbers under different people's names! No, not my mistake - checked this several times, and then spoke to a sales rep who said that this does indeed occur with this phone.4) Poor reception - the said Samsung had a much better reception in buildings. And it wasn't Sprint service either - T-mobile and Sprint are equivalently bad.5) Setup - very panful to readjust setup options/ringers.Overall, I don't like this phone at all. Very poor fundamentals - but it looks cool and has a (very useless, but still cool) camera.And, judging by Motorolas of my friends (Nextel models aside), I don't think I want to own another Motorola product.

From the deal I'm seeing on here, i wish i could have just canceled and got a new account, but thats too much effort.... anywho, my choices boiled down to getting the E105 or this v300.  I chose the v300 b/c of the extra gadgets (mainly the camera and speakerphone) even thought the rep said samsung users have a hard time getting used to the Motorola OS.She was wrong!  Navigation of this phone was a breath of fresh air!  i will say I preferred how the phone book was layed out better in the S105, but everything else is easier to use on this phone and the T-Zones is so much more functional!  I'm going to have to upgrade my plan to allow more internet usage! There also seems to be a much better seleciton of 3rd party applications and games for this phone which makes for better usability IMHO.Reception is the same as far as i can tell between the two (meaning signal strength).  Clarity is a tad better in the S105, but nothing worth chosing that over this.  If there is even the slightest background noise, they sound the same.  The S105 and this are almost identical in size, but the E105 was smaller... not a bid deal to me.Bottom line: If you are a prude about clarity and size, go with E105.

Almost lasts a week with minimal usage; 2 days with heavier use.-Battery meter is very inaccurate below 1/2 charge.  Seems chronic with Motorola phones.-Nice, clear display.  A bit hard to see in the brightest sunlight, but other than that, no problems.-Camera is of average quality at best.  Takes okay pictures for a new wallpaper, but that's about it.-Serious annoyance: One of the side buttons that remain exposed when the phone is closed controls the type of ring/vibrate.  It's very loud if you don't already have the phone on silent/vibrate only.  Basically, to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent--say in a theater--you have to make a loud noise.  Very short sighted.  And since the button is exposed even with the phone closed, you end up hitting it by accident quite a bit.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the phone.

I have had the phone for two weeks now and I have been very pleased.  The reception is a bit tinny sometimes, but overall I have not had any problems with dropped calls.I text message quite frequently and the phone offers you two choices for writing your text.  The first is an intuitive text entry method where the phone guesses the words that you are trying to type and displays them on the screen for you to choose.  This method is supposed to save time, but I have not yet gotten the hang of it.  The second method is the tried and true press each button for each letter method.  My only problem with the phone is that the buttons are not the same shape and are spaced apart which makes text messaging a bit trickier at first.  Plus the numbers and letters which are written on the buttons are very light and I often have to shift the angle of the phone in order just to read the buttons.  The light text might also be an issue for someone with vision problems.Overall, I would recommend this phone.

B000227PL8,"[170, 176]",5,"[Apart from minor issues like stability of the ""weighted"" base, this hub has been such a consistent, heavy-duty performer, while holding its price point (just short of 30) for exactly 4 years, that I've had to award it 5 stars (and order the identical model for my wife).  But just in the last 2 months the hub has been behaving completely opposite to expectations.  It goes totally dead with my hard drives, telling me that they're drawing too much power and therefore the hub is shutting them down until I remove them. But even when the hub is naked with the exception of a tiny flash drive, it remains dead, dark and non-communicative.  It comes back to life only when I disconnect the AC power and rely on nothing more than the power supplied by the USB ports.  That's fine, but not what I need with my 1TB (and bigger) hard drives, which until now had been showing on my computer's desktop with each start-up.  I'm about to call a rep in order to get an idea of what's going on and whether there's a fix (could it be Apple's latest update to OSX?  I'll be back pending further info.]I realized I needed a 7-port hub and checked out the D-Link, Kensington, Belkin--the usual suspects.  Then I chanced upon this unlikely contender, looking more like a jukebox in Amazon's picture than a hub.  I was intrigued by the off-beat design and noticed that the price was competitive (though a couple of the others are presently offering rebates, a free flylight, and other sweeteners). Now that I'm looking at the CyberPower USB port ""in person,"" I can provide a few initial impressions:1.  It's a lot smaller than the picture might imply.  Compactness is nice, but you also want a hub that will stay put and that allows sufficient space between adjacent plugs.2.  Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use, the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option.  Otherwise, you've got a lightweight (and fairly generic) loaded-up plug which could easily move around, dislodging the USB mini-plug (a necessary evil except for small cameras) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.3.  It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer, but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter. (To the manufacturer's credit, it's one of the slimmer, lighter wall-warts that I've seen.)4.  The flash drive mount is practical (but not unique).  Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.5.  The individual port lights are on all the time and, unlike most hubs, are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.In conclusion, it's a reliable performer and a convenient as well as eye-catching device--providing you go for the vertical look.  If I were to suggest one design improvement, it would be to ""fatten up"" the tower so that it would be wide enough to permit horizontal insertion of USB devices with the hub in vertical position.  Doing so would assure unforced accommodation of all your USB plugs, even the most space-devouring ones.  Biggest ""gripe"": the vertical design is not real stable.  The hub is easily dislodged from the base and bounces around quite a bit.  If I had to do it over, I'd look at the heavy, dome-shaped Kensington.[Revaluation after almost 3 years: I tried the Kensington. It was no more stable but less reliable. So I returned to the CyberPower, but without the base or vertical position.  I velcroed its back side to the wooden surface behind my desktop machine, with printer and two 500GB storage drives inputted to the rear, one USB cable from the front side to the USB of my iMac, and a flash drive connected to the top side of the hub.  Absolutely no problems.  This item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it's so good.  Should it ever fail, I doubt there's any other hub available that could surpass it. Forget the ""cuteness"" factor; this thing is all business.][4 years later: This ""off brand"" hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington ""round mound"" have fallen off the map, so this one is a proven winner.  Only lately I've had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large (1TB) hard drives. Before condemning the drive, I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches, permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices (iPods, mouse receivers, flash drives, printers, etc.) to run sheerly on USB power.]","01 17, 2008",A6FIAB28IS79,Samuel Chell,4 years of flawless performance (I even bought another for my wife)--until now.,1200528000,"Cyberpower CP-H420P USB Hub, 4-Port, USB 2.0, 480Mbps, 1.1/2.0 Compatible, PC/MAC PlugNPlay"

The draught from the AC vents on the car is enough to cause callers to complain.RF: With the v505 it takes an unreasonable amount of time for the headset and the phone to get it together. You can't answer the phone by switching the headset on when you hear it ringing, by the time it's connected to the phone the call is in voicemail. Received audio is OK, but whenever I used the headset I am told that I sound very digitized. As a communications engineer I believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.All in all I'd keep looking, which is why I'm browsing headsets now.In ten years I really haven't yet found a ""good"" headset, nothing approaching the standard of the military and aviation headsets I used to use, like comparing a ZX80 to a 3GHz Dell Pentium 4. Perhaps I just have unreasonable expectations, but if I could actually get a headset with good audio and good noise cancelling I'd pay a couple of hundred bucks. A decent noise cancelling headset will let you talk in a normal voice while standing between the exhausts of a 1500hp tank engine.","10 12, 2005",A377LPVLLAI42D,Chris,"OK battery life, questionable sound quality",1129075200,Motorola HS810 Bluetooth Headset

You can download pictures to and from your computer using a bluetooth connection (I did this using my Mac).Negative:The built-in email software is very poorly designed.

Someone didn't think about this enough. It takes me 7 clicks to delete a message -- that's too much. They don't take advantage of the keyboard enough: The keyboard has a Delete key, but you can't use it to delete a message. That's a waste. Likewise, you have to scroll through your emails one...line...at...a...time. Why not use the space bar as a quick scroller, like in Outlook? To issue a command, you have to use the menu and arrow keys. They should have assigned letter or number keys to each menu command so you can navigate more quickly with single keypresses. (My old Sony-Ericsson phone had this feature)The case is pretty, but because it's perfectly symmetrical, you can't tell which end is up by feel alone. The keyboard is so slick that you can't dial by feel either -- you need to look. These are safety issues. (but if you have a headset, you can dial by voice)So far, the battery doesn't last more than a day with below-average use.The A630 is best for people who want bluetooth, and who primarily talk or text, and who use POP3 occasionally, or not at all.","02 17, 2005",A1KE06KXZCYVWG,L.

To transfer the call to the headset, use the appropriate menu on the phone instead.* The ring on the headset is an irritating, non-modifiable melody. It would be nice to have a few options!* The headset is fairly large and dorky-looking.Despite these few drawbacks, don't forget that this is a very capable, well made and reliable headset at a bargain basement price, one of the best out there.

I was so frustrated to a point I was ready to go back to wired headset until I ran into this little guy.  This is by far the best one, hands down.  My most miserable experence was with Jabra and Motorola.  I had a lot of connection and audio quality issues with those brands.BT headset designers seem to favor visual appeal rather than performance.  I don't understand by most headsets on the market are short and stubby, in which the microphone is right next to your ear instead of your month.  Having microphone that far away results in having to turn up the microphone sensitivity, which cause the headset to pick up everything including background noise.  Lack of an effective noise-filtering system such as the one in this Logitech headset, you end up with wind noise, car noise, AC noise, every kind of noise but your voice.  In additional, the close promixity between the speak and microphone creates a feedback loop for a nice serving of constant echoing.  I lost count of the occasions when my friends and coworkers on the other end of the phone tell me to ""get off your crappy Jabra BT headset"" or ""take me off your Motorola BT headset"".  I am amazed that people on the other end can easily tell it's a Jabra BT headset because the horrid sound quality.Onto this gem, the sound quality is amazing, by far the best of the bunch.  The WindStop system really does work.  Together with the farther extending microphone, this unit produce the best sound both incoming and outgoing.  I know many users complaining about the fit, but it's really a fault of the user.  As one reviewer pointed out, there is a ""correct"" way to wear this, and I think it provides an excellent fit and comfort.I can't speak for all, but I personally don't wear a BT headset as a fashion statement.  I use it as a mean for convenience and safety, so sound quality and fit are top factors for my consideration.  On that note, this is a clear winner.  I wish product managers and designers at Motorola and particularly Jabra take note of that.  Jabra (250 and 250v models) being the worst with it's behind the ear design and a heavy-trigger button is really a very lousy product in terms of usability and sound quality.

This headset already has enough wireless range to cover half the floor in my building, so the ability to answer the phone at such a distance is extremely useful in a bunch of situations. A couple of key features:When a call comes in, either Intercom or from an external line, there is a chime in my ear that alerts me to the call. I can then press the single button on the headset and the receiver is lifted, allowing me to receive the call.When the call is done, I press the single button again and the receiver hangs up.It's about as simple as conceivably possible.The install instructions were however less than perfect. To get this to work properly, I have to unplug the phone base from the handset and in to the Plantronics unit. The handset is then plugged in to the Plantronics unit. This was not explicitly stated in the install instructions. It took 10-15 minutes to figure out the trick.

Depending on your phone's angle and the conformation of the receiver, it may work or not. My phone is a Toshiba digital phone and I was able to get this to work only by angling the phone almost horizontally, which makes it look stupid on my desk and also makes it hard to read the LCD and caller ID.Installing it is a bit twitchy, as you have to temporarily mount it somehow on the side of the phone as you play with where it is to sit, and if it's angled correctly. That's because the stickum adhesive is pretty permanent, so you have to decide the optimum  placement before you attach it. I had to resort to duct tape for this step.I'm going to be frank and say I have a love-hate (maybe mostly hate) relationship with Plantronics equipment. I go through headsets lately like nobody's business. My first one lasted 10 years! That was excellent. But the next one lasted 2 minutes (an M22) which only lasted that long because I tap danced on it before I threw it in the trash. The latest is a CS540 which I will review once I have one that doesn't arrive DOA. That's right, dead out of the box. I got it overnight shipped, only to diagnose a bad cable from receiver to amplifier (which will take a week to get replaced.) Nice!

Memory card slot is nice.  It's fast. Bluetooth sync with my Mac Powerbook is awesome - no more plugging up cables to HotSync! Handfree in the Prius works great.

I don't understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people, or how I can be made to feel like they're doing me a favor by standing behind their product.  I am the customer!  Doesn't that mean anything anymore?I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad (though Amazon's remains very, very good).  When a person spends $400 on a phone, or any device, it should work longer than a few weeks.  But when it does stop working, the company that sold it should stand behind their product, instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility.  Subsequent to this occurrence, other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s, as well.There are other issues with this phone.  Out of the box, the power/sync cord did not work.  I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced.  (I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle, which works fine.) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume.  Every so often, the phone just resets itself - can't figure this one out at all.  Also, when someone calls in on Call-Waiting, you cannot disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call; in other words, when you accept the Call-Waiting call, it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously, even when the first party hangs up.  This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also, there are limited, non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone.  And don't get this phone for its camera: cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise, all the Palm applications work as they should, and as they have for the past number of years.  Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all, I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device.  My company will stop using Palm, and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint (when contracts start to expire).My apologies for the rant, but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers.  Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore?  I know mine tries to; otherwise, we're out of business.","04 20, 2006",A3QYIBMXQVLVE7,G. Crain,"Sadly, I'm leaving Palm",1145491200,PCS Phone Palm Treo 650 (Sprint)

I get so much use from this phone, not only for the phone itself, but for the PDA capabilites. I have never been so organized and on top of things.

B0006FLA80,"[21, 24]",4,"I've owned a Palm of some type for about seven years, and had a cell phone for slightly less time.  I've always resisted buying a combined device, because I thought ""they aren't ready yet.""  When it came time to replace my PDA, I decided that the Treo 650 might be ready.  I had concerns about the size of the screen, and about integrating PDA and cell phone functions.  Overall, most of my nervousness about it was groundless.  I am pleased with the phone so far.Good points:Works well as a phone--Better signal than the Nokia phone it replacesScreen is very readable, even though it is smaller than on a traditional PDAPalm functionality is fine.  The interface has been redesigned a bit, and you seldom need the stylus.  Most entries are done with the rocker switch at bottom center of the screen, or with the keypad.  You truly can do many functions one-handed.  But they managed to do this without losing the feel of the Palm, you aren't having to re-learn from zero.The memory is non-volatile--In English, this means that if your batteries go dead, you don't lose all your data till you re-synch your Palm.Bad points:Those who complain about a slight delay when dialing from a number in the Palm contacts list are right.  It's not really a problem, but it is an annoying couple of second delay.If you are one of those who read books on Palms, I'm not sure the screen will do for prolonged reading.Battery life is fair.  I am able to get two days out of it with medium use, and have a bit of life left in the battery.  Not like the days of the monochrome Palms when you'd go for a week between recharges!It's only so-so as a web browser.The price is hideously high.Keyboard is cramped, but about as good as you can expect on such a small device.  It is definitely useable.  My instinct was to use my right thumb only, but I now believe the people who claim that if you use both hands (thumbs only) you'll be faster.From what I've seen of the Treo 600, I do not believe the upgrade would be worth it for those who currently own a 600.  If you are waiting to make the jump into a combined PDA/phone, I believe thhis is a good point to do it.","02 9, 2005",A2E2I580OO3HET,"M.

B0006I2G3U,"[6, 6]",5,"I bought this phone because it was a Editors choice in a leading computer magazine.  I would have preferred the Motorola V3 Razor but that is still far too expensive and I have found that this phone is basically the same as the Razor just not as thin or stylish.Plus points of this phone include:- A beautiful screen. It is large, bright, and has excellent resolution.- very good pictures from the camera.  I can't believe that it is just .3 megapixels... of course you won't be able to blow them up into posters or anything like that but for viewing on a computer or even the occasional 3x5 print the pictures are very good.- excellent sound quality from the speaker so your ringtones and the speakerphone sound great.- very nice construction with a easy to grip rubberized metal trim and back.- the button layout is very nice with a dedicated button for taking pictures and volume buttons on the side.  Also of note is that most of the buttons are user programable.- the phone also has voice dialing and picture caller id (although the pictures are very small and do not appear on the external display)- the bluetooth is very easy to set up and use- it is a true Quad band phone that can be used worldwide (although it has to be unlocked first).- excellent battery life.  I can't believe some of the reviews that say it needs to be charged every day... I find myself charging the phone after about 4-5 days with moderate use.  Of course I have the screen saver turned off and I make sure that the bluetooth is disabled when I am not using it so maybe that is why I have great stanby and talk times.  Also the place where I purchased my phone told me to charge it for 24 hours before the first use (to condition the Li battery) so maybe this has helped to increase the battery life.The Negative points about this phone include:- the blue external display looks cool but I think it would be more visible if it were typical backlit black on white LCD (like on the motorola v180)- the instruction manual (like most Motorola manuals) does not do a good job of explaining all the features so you will have to play with the phone a little bit to fully make use of all that this phone can do.- Even though the pictures from the camera are excellent, the video quality is not so good.  Of course this is a cell phone not a video camera so I guess it is about what you would expect.  Also there is no flash on the camera (unlike some other camera phones) so low light pictures are not that great.- there is no USB port on the phone so unless you want to buy a motorola cable, the only way to transfer pictures to your computer (and mp3's to your phone) is via bluetooth. (HINT: you can get a bluetooth adapter for less than $20 bucks so don't waste your money buying the motorola cable. Also with the bluetooth adapter you won't need any special software to transfer pictures or mp3... just use the software with the bluetooth adapter).- the connector for the charger has the typical motorola design so occasionally you have to jiggle it to get it to fit in just right but make sure that your PRESS the button on the connector before removing it or else you will damage the contacts... this may be why some users are having problems charging their phones- the phone only comes in blue so it does not look as cool as other motorola phones like the v180 or the razorAll in all this is the best phone that I have owned.  User's who complain about call drops and bad signals should be complaining about the carrier and not the phone.  Personally I have noticed that ever since the Cingular and AT&T; merger, signal quality and call quality have both declined.  A Cingular rep told me it is temporary until they are able to better integrate both networks... this makes sense because I have only had this problem since I switched my SIM card to the new Cingular SIM that makes use of both networks.","09 5, 2005",A35IX2GE0VC0JP,"FirePepper Red ""firepepper red""",Excellent Phone,1125878400,Motorola V551 Phone (AT&T)

I do charge it every night; however, I've found that the Bluetooth radio makes a very significant difference in battery life, which may spur some of the complaints about the shorter battery life than the V400 (no BT capability on that one).  It is possible to turn off the BT radio if you don't need it for any accessories or connections.  My charge lasts for several days if I do this.  I really don't feel inconvenienced by charging daily and leaving BT on, though.In general, the phone has great screen quality (compared directly to my friends' V400s), great speakerphone and polyphonic ringtone capability, great sound quality at both ends, great voice dialing performance (very useful with headset), and I'm entirely satisfied with the camera, considering it IS a cellphone camera.I'll admit the interface was a bit cumbersome at first, but it's VERY customizable with changeable function keys, shortcuts, and menu orders.  I find mine very efficient since I've tweaked it to suit my tastes and usage.Additionally, contrary to some previous reviews, I have successfully transferred both information (phone book, etc.) and media (pictures, ringtones, etc.) to and from the phone with my Bluetooth adapter on my PC, without using Cingular's services.  I did have some trouble getting it to work initially, but I found that it was my firewall getting in the way (remember, Bluetooth IS a network connection).I suppose my one complaint is the conspicuous absence of games (only comes with a Bejeweled demo), but in the end it doesn't really bother me.  I could buy a game for $4 if I really wanted one.Overall, I find the phone very feature-rich and high quality, efficient to use once customized, and as rugged as the average cellphone.","04 26, 2005",A2ZZGWC4FUGJAE,M.

The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure.

I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel. Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip, full support for bluetooth (although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling.

B0006I2G3U,"[32, 34]",4,"Bottom LineStrongly recommended.  This phone replaced a highly-rated NEC 525 so my assessment is largely in comparison to it.  Based on my research, the V551 has virtually the same features as the much more expensive Razr V3(although not as thin and made largely of plastic rather than brushed aluminum).  From the many online reviews I've read, early versions of the V551 had problems with lockups and dropped calls.  I haven't seen many of those types of comments lately so I'm assuming Motorola worked the kinks out.Pros--Very good reception and sound quality.  Gets three and four bars in my office; I had to stand by the window to use the NEC--It's nice looking; the body is mostly plastic but appears solidly made (the NEC was plug ugly).  Nice raised number keys.--Calls and rings can be made very loud (which is good since I often carry it in a pocket or briefcase, or have it in the car with the sunroof open and music blaring)--Decent quality pictures for a phone camera--Bluetooth--MP3 ringtones; also extensive selection of built in ringtones (although most aimed at young users rather than professionals).--Good speaker phone function--EDGE makes for fast web browsing--Excellent procedure for downloading and saving data via WAP--much easier than the NEC--I can now access Hotmail which I couldn't with the NEC--Nice looking screen--ITAP text entry system works better than the similar function on the NEC--Good voice dialing (the voice tags on my NEC simply took me to that phone book entry and didn't actually dial which the Moto does)--Ability to change ring volume and method (to include a useful vibrate then ring method) with external keys is very handy; ring volume can be made very loud--Buttons and functions are highly customizable--Very good date book--Quad band (I've used my NEC and the Siemens it replaced in about a dozen countries, including Iraq)--Nice price ($74 from AT&T;)Cons--Organization of the phone book is a common complaint but once I figured it out, it's fine.  You can store five numbers and an email per entry. (You must save entries to the phone not the SIM, and organize by primary listing).  It's not the best--the NEC allowed multiple emails plus other information--but it works.--Battery life is also a complaint but I found that by following Moto's recommendations--completely discharge and re-charge it the first few times--it's fine.  Now I can go 3 to 5 days between charges with normal use.  (As another reviewer noted, the battery life was short for the first few days I had it but then improved dramatically.)--Physically the V551 is a bit thick compared not only to my NEC but also to my previous Motos--a Star Tac and V60.  But it does fit in a suit jacket pocket--Speaker phone function can only be turned on during a call, not before--Maximum time before the screen turns off for power saving is 20 seconds.  You have to touch a key to make it come back on.  This can interfere with things like downloads--Screen icons are small and fuzzy; the user's manual doesn't explain what they are--Small navigation keys, but that's the price you pay for a relatively small phone--Of the three built-in skins, two are glaringly bright and tacky.  As with the ringtones, Moto was clearly focused on young users rather than professionals--When using a Bluetooth headset, the V551 will only use a cheesy, stock ringtone--personal ones will not work--You have to go through the recognition routine with a Bluetooth device every time you use it (although this only takes about ten seconds).--Works great with a Moto Bluetooth headset but I've had less luck linking with a non-Moto Bluetooth adapter for my computer--Lousy user's manual--Lousy user's manual--Did I mention the lousy user's manual? (this is inexcusable)--Voice dialing is not universal.  In other words, it ""learns"" one voice rather than responding to anyone saying the correct word or phrase.--Stubby antenna (although this is a trade-off: I get better reception than with the internal antenna on my NEC)--I would have been happy to pay the extra fifty cents or so it would have cost to have real metal on the front instead of plastic made to look like metal.--The synchronization software (Motorola Mobile Phone Tools)and cable cost extra.  I have not been able to make it function.  Motorola's support is utterly worthless--I asked for help online and they told me to call them.  Two attempts led to disconnects after 10-15 minutes on hold without ever getting to an actual tech person.  The software developer--BVRP--is trying to help but hasn't been able to fix the problem.  I may seek a refund from the online vendor and look into alternative sync software.","05 27, 2005",A3LSLLR3OAJI7Y,Steven Metz,I'm Very Pleased,1117152000,Motorola V551 Phone (AT&T)

Cards are held securely and the pocket is just deep enough for bills folded in half. Plus, it is very stylish. I have received several compliments and questions regarding where they can get their own.

When I put the phone in the case, it came out almost immediately. Solution: take the back cover off the phone then put it in the case. It holds it much more securely and now I don't have to worry about it. The case itself seems well made and thicker than I had hoped, but hopefully that will protect the phone well. The one thing I am worried about is how thin the plastic is that holds the phone in the case.

Personally, I loved the Twelve-South's bookbook case for iPhone 4/4S, but didn't like the new Twelve-South bookbook case for iPhone 5 and I returned mine - it looked cheaply made, it was an extremely tight, awkward fit getting the phone into the clip and the case had large remnants of glue coming out of the over-sized piece of plastic they decided to stick in the (rather enormous) hole they cut for the camera.  This product is better quality than the Twelve South product.  It certainly looks and feels like real leather, although I suspect it may not be (based on its smell).

Seems to be actual leather unlike many similar cases that claim to be leather and are actually plastic. So if you wear skinny jeans and tend to keep the phone shoved in a pocket, this is not for you. But if you carry it elsewhere and are not concerned with combining your phone with some essential bits of your wallet, this is really really nice. If you tend to travel in a car and wind up carrying both the phone and your wallet into places to eat. This allows you to get three basic things out of the wallet and eliminate the need to carry two into the restaurant.It makes holding onto the phone less complicated by a factor of a googol. Particularly in landscape.The material (seems to be leather) is impregnated with a serious amount of oil so when you close the lid, it leaves a mark on the face of the phone. The simple solution to this is to get a paper index card, fold it at the red line on the top and shove the little folded bit in to the slot behind the cards.

B000DZXIRY,"[0, 0]",5,"Cliffnotes summation-  AWESOME well thought out easy to install product.......!!!Details-Purchased the CS55/HL10 after an Amazon price match locally. Been using the standard Plantronics corded headset for years on my old ATT 4 line business phone. I finally got tired of the corded limitations and researched this unit online.Basically the system installs nicely and the ""handset lifter"" is included($39 value)at the Amazon price. My older phone supports a headset but is not configured for the newer headset connection option which this Plantronics unit also supports. The lifter is simple to install and powered from the Plantronics headset recharger base. Handset and speakerphone capabilities are not affected by installation of the lifter device under the handset. You can use your phone handset if your earpiece is still charging or be really lazy and just use the speakerphone if your situation allows that.With the lifter installed you simply put the headset on your ear, push a button on the earpiece and the lifter raises the phone hand set about 1/2 inch out of the cradle and your line becomes active. Then dial your number or hit the your speed dialer on whatever phone you are hooking the system to. What really clinches the deal on this system is that you can use your older desk telephone without having to spend additional funds on a landline phone set.Wireless frequencies-The new wireless frequency standard is extremely clear and static free with my office Netgear N900 and DLink N-Wireless routers up and running without any equipment or frequency conflicts that plague the older systems that may have caused major problems in the past. During my test calls and walking around testing in the house the voice quality and signal was crystal clear at all times.Good installation instruction manual and online help if you need it make this a real snap to install.

Range is easily 50 ft+  I like to pace while I talk on tough calls, and this unit is flawless for that!  ;)---The Plantronics CS55 is a nice desk-based bluetooth unit.  I use it on an Inter-Tel phone system at work.  The body of the unit connects to your telephone line, an AC adapter, and a unit that sits on your phone to lift up the receiver during calls.  So there are a lot of wires, but you can tuck it away at the edge of your desk.  The ear piece, which charges on the main unit body, is pretty hefty and I generally have a hard time getting to hang on my ear securely. But it is flexible and after a few moments of adjustment, it stays pretty well but still wobbles around a bit.  Earpiece quality is very good.  For speaking into the unit, you will need to recrd yourself at different mouthpiece placements (e.g., talk call in to your own voice mail).  The mic picks up lots of noise (rustling of clothes, breathing, drinking, etc.), so it is good t be aware of how these are being heard by doing some testing.

The sound quality is excellent with really impressive bass response.  Now I am pairing this with an LG VX8700 and perhaps that makes some difference.  There are some minor issues though.  Placing the phones properly on your head can mean that they are comfortable for a time, but eventually after about 2 hours they do seem to pinch. But even then it is not unbearable.  I have cycled with them, music stops when you answer and then resumes.  I have jogged with them, ear pieces pop off so you can rinse if necessary. Occasionally either the phone or the headset gets confused if you are trying to do something too fast.  Flipping through songs, and you have to re-pair the device.  Sound quality is pretty good through the microphone considering the distance.  Very slightly muffled, but still clear enough to not be a limiting factor.  A cool feature is that tap the right ear piece and it opens the music player on the phone and starts playing.  Jabra should consider putting a locking button at an appropriate location because it is easy to inadvertently push one of the many buttons when you are taking off or adjusting the phones.  Eventually you do learn how to handle to avoid this, but it is quirky.  I would so recommend this headset for those looking for something to pair with one of the newer phones that support a2d over bluetooth.  Excellent for cycling!Update 8/22/07  This headset continues to operate great, despite being dropped numerous times. As a side note, I found as I was riding today that the pairing between my lg vx 8700 was fouled as the music was intermittent.  While there is the occasional stumble in the otherwise smooth streaming, this was different.  I ended up removing the device from my 8700 and re-pairing it.  Fixed.  The only thing I can think of is that I had recently unplugged my phone while it was docked in usb mode to my pc and you are not supposed to do that without ending via the menu first.I use this headset to run with too and found a little floss can go along way.  Yep, I tied a bit of floss between the ear pieces leaving one side with a simple knot.  Then with the floss in position across the top of my head I pulled the ear pieces down until the plastic pieces which normally end up pinching the tops of the ears were just above the tops.  I then double knotted the simple knot again and voila, the floss helps support the headset while you are running and the pinching that I noted in my original review is reduced greatly.  I am actually sitting typing this listening to some Petty. Great stuff...","05 29, 2007",AATWFX0ZZSE6C,Faja4x,Excellent Sound Quality,1180396800,"Jabra BT620s - Bluetooth stereo headset for mobile phones, music players, PCs and other Bluetooth devices"
B000E7YSWK,"[2, 2]",4,"The battery life on these is phenomenal. I've been using these headphones with theJabra Bluetooth Music Adapterand the headphones outlast the adapter every time, and we're talking about 8+ hours of constant use.I'm also using this headset along with my PC and my RazrV3m. The phone does not support Stereo Bluetooth Audio (A2DP) but it does support the regular headset profile that most, if not all Bluetooth enabled phones have. This means that the headphones work as a regular wireless headset for any Bluetooth enabled phone or Skype on your PC / Mac.On the PC, the headphones provide the mic input, the mono headset feature and the stereo headset feature. This means that I can be watching a video or listening to music in beautiful stereo sound and if a call comes though on Skype, it'll switch over to the microphone & mono headset profile for the VOIP conversation. The same is true for using the music adapter mentioned above and a mobile phone. When a call comes in, the music pauses / mutes (depending on the device) and you can answer the call by tapping the left ear piece. Tapping the right ear piece will pause / mute the music at any time.Sound quality is actually very impressive. If you're using these with your PC and the sound is coming through mudddy and crackly, it means that you're not using the Stereo (higher audio quality as well) profile. It's quite possible to listen to music using the Mono (used for mobile phone conversations) profile, but you're missing the great sound if you do.A great thing about the sound quality is that the range is quite wide. I hear certain things in music with these headphones that my iPod and Zune headphones just wont reproduce. The headphones are not earbuds (or earplugs as I call them) so you can actually still hear someone if they speak to you, that is you won't be completely oblivious.They came with a wall charger as well as a USB cable so that's very nice. The manual says not to use any other cables to charge the headphones, but  close observation will reveal that it's just an ordinary USB-A to USB-Mini-B cable.

They have paired easily with every device I've tried, and even work very well as a hands free headset for a bluetooth cell phone. However, they don't work with my Mac, and contrary to the insinuation by the other reviewer, this is in no way Jabra's fault. Bluetooth is bluetooth, and it's up to the computer manufacturer to support the ""profiles"" supported by various devices. In the case of the Mac, Apple's Bluetooth support is incomplete; they don't handle the advanced audio profile required for stereo headsets, and so this headset (or ANY other stereo bluetooth headset, for that matter) will not work with a Mac until Apple decides to fix this. This is completely out of Jabra's control, and this is a very well engineered device. If you own a Window's XP computer, this will work very well.The only negative I can find is that the headset is not adjustable and thus may not fit everybody comfortably.

I paired it with my Sanyo Katana DLX and quite a few of the negatives stuck out to me right away. For starters i luv my music loud and when listening to these headphones the sound is simply mediocre. It sometimes emits a lot of static as well. The buttons on each side are extremely easy to push and after wearing them for maybe 15-20 minutes it tends to make my left ear quite tender causing a readjustment or simple rest from it. I was really satisfied with my jabra bt500 and had faith that this one would deliver as well but in the end it was just ok. I also attempted the firmware download and it made not one difference it almost seemed as if it made it slightly worse. I'm thinking maybe it has something to do with the type of cell phone I have. It also seems at certain points during the song the music would come to a slow and then speed up during song, strange. It would really be helpful if people would list the type of c.phone they have so potential buyers would see and possibly keep looking if c.phones listed turn out to be incompatible.

Now the price is within reason, so I went for it and extended my plan.I'm not sure what all the complaints are about. The phone is very thin and once in your pocket you hardly know it's there, and the lack of an external antenna makes it much easier to get out of your pocket. It has a nice feel to it and is wide enough so it doesn't feel like a toy.  I have very small hands and have little trouble working everything with one hand. The ""flat"" buttons don't bother me, but I wish the OK button in the middle of the toggle ring was raised up just a bit.  I find myself using my thumbnail to press it.I'm having no trouble with hearing people, and the ringers are just loud enough for me.  The complaint about several button being located on the flip up cover are not a real problem.  If they were on the lower part of the phone you would be pressing them all the time.Yes, the screen is difficult to see in bright daylight, but aren't they all, including most cameras and PDA's.The voice activation feature worked right away, after installing some contacts, and made few mistakes.I also got the GPS Maps feature and the Web option.  I have not had a chance to really test the GPS, but it did locate my position within a house or two.  The Web option seems to work very well and I was able to get lots of info quite easily and rather quickly.I did spend some time with Verizon on the phone to learn how to activate these features and learn how to use them, but I've always found Verizon service to be excellent, and the person stayed with me until I had all the features down.I was told that the Razr has gone through some software changes and unlike the stories I've heard, the top does not feel like it's going to fly off the phone across the room. It feels really solid considering how thin it is.I would say if you've been waiting now is the time. It looks like they've gotten some of the bugs out of the phone, and while it does take awhile to get over the learning curve, for any advance features, I really like this phone a lot.Is it perfect?  Not at all, but it is extremely popular, and it's been around long enough so you can find just about anything for this phone on the Net.I would have given it 5 stars, but it's just confusing enough learning how to use it I had to give it 4.Also, like others have said:  If you want a decent camera get a decent camera.  If you want a decent PDA get a decent PDA.  If you want an iPod get an iPod. This is a very good phone with lots of extra features, but it's not perfect.

I don't like carrying a wireless on a belt clip so love to slip this baby in my shirt pocket--Nice, easy-to-read screen. I wouldn't want to watch TV on it, but that isn't why I buy a wireless phone.--VZ Navigator. This was what inspired me to switch from Cingular. It is a fantastic feature. I've tested it about ten times and it has been spot on, with accurate on-screen prompts, voice instructions, and estimated time of arrival. It turns me right into the driveway I need.  If you miss a turn, it recalculates new instructions in a matter of seconds.  The only down side is that it works from the quickest route and has no way for you to override that.  For instance, I went to friend's house and it had me get on a toll road for a few miles.  This WAS the shortest route, but not one I would normally have taken.--Voice recognition system works great. It doesn't have to be ""taught"" and can access all items in the contact list, prepare a blank text message, or dial a dictated number--Clearest calls I've had in a wireless phone.  You sometimes hear ""the people I'm talking to can't tell I'm on a wireless.""  That's been my experience with this handset.Cons--Strength of reception not quite as good as a handset with an external antenna, even a stubby one.--I wish they hadn't taken away the vibrate+ring option.  The Razr has to be either on vibrate with no sound or ring.  I also wish there was some sort of external LED to indicate when I missed a call or have voice mail.  As is, you have to open the Razr to check this.  An NEC handset I had a few years ago had very nice system with different color LEDs.--Verizon's proprietary menu system is more difficult to use than the organic Motorola one and takes away some customization options such as setting hot keys. I also haven't found a way to turn off unnecessary prompts (""Do you really want to delete this missed call?"").  There is also no way (at least that I have found) to change the red band at the top and bottom of the screen. It only looks decent with some sort of red wallpaper.--Verizon has the phone locked down so it's difficult or impossible to add pictures and ringtones without paying them.--It's plastic (the Amazon review is just plain wrong on this point). I wish there was still the option of buying a metal Razr like the first generation ones. I would have paid extra for it.  Like all phones, I'm sure it will scratch with use and be more susceptible to breaking.--I could not synchronize the built in calendar with Outlook.  I subscribed to a separate calendar synchronization program from Verizon (iDatebook) which works well but creates a separate calendar rather than using the built in one.--The Razr uses BREW for applications so there are fewer available than in java.  I particularly miss World Mate for international travel (especially the currency converter) and a shopping list application.--It's CMDA only so for for international travel, I've had to unlock an old handset and will just buy prepaid SIMsAll in all, though, the V3m may be my favorite wireless handset of the seven I've owned over the years.","07 12, 2006",A3LSLLR3OAJI7Y,Steven Metz,The VZ Navigator Is Worth the Price,1152662400,Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless)
B000G7LWRM,"[7, 7]",2,"Overall this is a bad phone. The main reason I purchased it was because it's very thin and has no antenna. The reception is good and voices come in clear both ways. This is where the positives stop. The worst aspect of the phone is the poor battery life. I have even disabled EVDO so it won't switch between it and 1x when moving around town (which drains the battery).The Verizon software makes the phone useless. You cannot have the phone ring and vibrate at the same time, you cannot change the horrible wallpaper on the front LCD, and you cannot change the color scheme from red. Verizon has also disabled the use of Motorola Phone Tool, which enables you to put your own ringtones and media on the phone. You are forced to purchase media from the VCast service. Even if you wouldn't normally use media on your phone, you should object to this because of principal. It's corporate greed at its finest and Verizon is preventing you from using the full capabilities of your purchase.It does have a decent camera, but it's functionality is limited. It takes video clips, but nothing over 15 seconds. There are sites that tell you how to hack the phone, but it's not worth the time and risk of ruining the phone.The pluses: very thin, no antenna, sleek designCons: horrible user interface, very few options to change the appearance, many of the phone's functionality has been disabled by VerizonConclusion: buy something else.

B000GUKT9Q,"[3, 3]",3,"The Motorola H350 bluetooth headset is one of the cheaper models out there, and it shows.PAIRINGThe H350 pairs like most bluetooth headsets. Tell your phone to search for headsets, then hold down the H350 main button for about 10 seconds. Your phone finds the H350 and you hit ""ok."" This works as expected and is no different from any other bluetooth headset. I've used this headset with my Motorola RAZR and Uniden landline bluetooth-capable phone.COMFORT/DESIGNThe H350 has an earclip that easily pops off so that you can fit the headset onto either ear. The clip itself is flexible rubber and while it seems moderately comfortable at first, I find my ear starts to hurt after about 30 minutes. Ideally, I do not want to notice or feel that I'm wearing a headset. I definitely cannot say that about the H350. The speaker lightly rests over your ear canal. There are two volume buttons on the top and bottom of the headset to increase, decrease, or mute the speaker.SOUND QUALITYI've tried quite a few headsets out there from Plantronics, Motorola and Jabra to compare. Most of them have some deficiencies, and the H350 is no different. People on the other end of my conversations state that while my voice is clear, it sounds a little ""far-away."" I also think that the highest volume ability of the H350 speaker on my end is still too weak (yes, I have perfectly normal hearing). When you max out the speaker volume the sound becomes a bit distorted and it's still not loud enough to clearly hear the other caller while driving in a car, even with the windows all the way up. This is in stark contrast to the Plantronics 640-665 series which have jelly earpieces that comfortably squish into your ear canal for optimal volume and clarity. As a result, I can only recommend the H350 for home use where there isn't alot of background noise present.OVERALLAt it's basic level, the Motorola H350 bluetooth headset works. You maintain a good connection between it and your phone within 10-12 feet (like any other functional headset). However, it's shortcomings in volume and mic quality cannot be overlooked. I only recommend this headset if you plan on using it at home or in the office, and only if you got it for a great price. If you need higher quality, you may want to open your wallet a little more and look into that Plantronics 640-665 line.","04 3, 2008",A1OZA52DFY3SHD,Gaz Rendar,Only decent quality.

B000GUKT9Q,"[19, 19]",4,"Overall I have had a good experience with this device. Here are some of the pros and cons so you can get some basis for comparison when purchasing one BT headset:PROS1. Price. I got this device for $33. I don't think you can get a comparable BT headset for a lower price.2. Sound Quality. This device has good volume level and low static.  I have streched it all the way to the range limit (30 ft.) and the call quality is still good with no static.  I have left my phone or computer in the living room/middle level of my townhome and have gone up and down the stairs to other rooms without loosing the call.3. Compatibility.  I haven't had any issues pairing this device up with the following devices: Motorola PEBL, Nokia E62 and HP Pavillion laptop. I have used remote commands such as voice commands, redial or answer with the two phones with no issues, and have used it with Skype and MSN Messenger without any problem.  One user commented that the personalized/group ring tones did not transmit to the BT headset, but this is a limitation of the phone, because the MotoPEBL does not transmit a specific ring tone assigned to a person, and rather a default one, but the Nokia E62 sends the proper ring tone to the headset so you know who is calling without having to look at the phone (good when driving!)4. Battery life.  I have not tried really long calls so I can not comment on exact talk time, but overall I have used it continously in stand-by plus regular calls (for me 10-15 minutes, 4-5 calls a day) without recharging for 3-4 days.CONS:1. Bad Design.  As noted by other users, the device wiggles in your ear and you feel it is going to fall when you walk, move your head (sudden movements) or even driving (believe it or not, the inertia when making turns on you car makes this BT headset to move away from your ear, almost falling).  A strong wind will knock it out from your ear.  It fits ok, though, and does not hurt your ear (not heavy at all).  Perhaps that is the main reason why it wiggles so much, maybe it is too light.2. Powering on/off.  Since it only has one main button (two small ones for volume +/- and mute) that you use for power, pairing, answering or dial commands, then you can, for example, get into pairing mode when simply turning it on, or if attached to a phone, you may redial a call rather than turning it off.  Once you learn how to use it and pay attention to the blue led signals, it is ok, but I think it requires one extra button for power on/off.Overall I am satisfied with the purchase. If it weren't for the two CONs, I would have rated it with 5 starts.","03 7, 2007",A3E3L2A4QV1799,"Sergio Hernandez ""Amorcholoco""",Good Price. Good sound.

Not only did it sound a lot worse to people on the other end, but it sounded a lot more choppy on my receiving end as well.It stays in my ear fairly well, even without the ear loop -- just the eargel.  BUT...The eargels unclip too easily when in a pocket, bag, or ESPECIALLY when in the pocket-clip charger.  If I have it clipped on my pocket, the eargel faces out and unavoidably rotates to its removal position.  When I brush up against anything the eargel flips out.  I've lost two eargels now and it just sits in a drawer.They should have designed a better retention mechanism on the eargel with some kind of positive release mechanism, and/or have the eargel facing back when it's in the clip in a pocket so it won't get torn off.I also hated the force required on the buttons.  I never used the volume controls (always did it from the phone), and I dreaded getting calls because I'd have to MASH the answer button into my head.One more thing -- It's always getting ""unpaired"" from my Treo 680.  I have to go through the Treo menus to get it to pair again.  To be honest, this may have to do with the Treo more than the headset, but the two do not like each other that well.The Discovery 650 without the DSP had much better audio quality, slightly lighter force on the buttons, but the same problems with eargels getting torn off in my pocket.--- UPDATE ---I called Plantronics tech support and they immediately sent me out new eargels.

It works, but it could be much much better.First, I think technology still has a long way to go with regards to bluetooth/wireless headsets.  Sound quality on this thing, while loud enough, made everyone sound like they were talking through several layers of tshirts. Everyone I've spoken to on this says they can tell I'm ""on something"" but that I sound ""fine.""  Fine isn't good enough for me.Let's talk design: It absolutely excels in the ""Cool"" department - it looks slick and isn't some chubby ear thing.  But, with that cool looking factor comes a lose and ill-fitting earpiece.  Yes, it comes with 3 replacable earpieces, but none fit me quite right. I would like to offer this suggestion to all who own/consider owning this: When you are trying to insert this into your ear, take your hand opposite the side of the ear you are putting this in, grab the top of your earlobe and pull up while twisting this thing into your ear canal. I got it to fit OK but walking around with it - it feels like it's going to fall out any second.The buttons: Yes they are small but we are all aware that as technology shrinks, so are the buttons. Yes, they are difficult to use, but I'm used to it and you should be too.  Main problem: Is that you really have to press down for the buttons to click, and this thing is already ready to fall out of your ear, so trying to slam on a button isn't helping.  Why someone doesn't put a nice little trackwheel for volume on one of these things is beyond me.You can walk around with this but you'll want to keep your phone nearby - I walked into the next room not more than 10 feet from the phone and it got static, etc.  Pretty weak if you ask me.It works OK. It paired up with my Motorolla KRZR just fine and works no problem. I wonder if the Motorolla headsets work better with Motorola phones.The main reason I got it is for when I drive because I don't like being on my cell while driving and everyone seems to want to call me when I'm driving.

B000HBIUNG,"[0, 0]",1,"Although weight, sound and battery are good, I really dislike this headset's design. If you are a totally predictable person who does the same thing every day and never gets dirt on your cuffs, it's ok. If you are on the go, the wire clip will come loose in your pocket or in your computer bag. The pen holder doesn't do anything to shield the clip, in fact it adds weight that causes more force against the exposed headset. I had to recrimp the loop to make it tight enough not to come loose. The pen cap itself is required baggage for no good reason. Rather than give you a standard mini usb connector on the device, you must now haul this cap everywhere. Hey, I don't always wear a shirt with pockets. After two weeks I misplaced it on a trip and so the expensive headset is sitting on the shelf while I ponder whether to buy another useless pen clip or to cook up my own connector. There is no excuse for non-standard connectors and charging solutions, but watch this company do it over again.(several months later) I finally am tossing out this headset. The pen clip holder was eventually found and I tried to make a go with this device. I don't like to get rid of working items, but I have had the earpiece and ear hook fall off many times in my pocket and this last time, they fell elsewhere and are lost. Would you believe it couldn't even stand up to the pressure of the inside of my suit coat? I did get a box to carry it in, but that was cumbersome because of the charging holder, and now it doesn't matter because I would have to buy a new hook and earpiece. Just ordered a Motorola H500, lower cost, lots of color choices and very long talk time PLUS a standard mini USB jack. I got a travel case for less than $4. Got one for my daughter for Xmas and she proved it to be a better headset.","11 26, 2008",A2MYRMQWSWGR29,Mars Trader,"Good sound, fundamental design flaws, now in the waste bucket",1227657600,Plantronics Discovery 655 DSP Ultimate Bluetooth Headset with DSP [Retail Packaging] (Discontinued by Manufacturer)
B000HBIUNG,"[5, 5]",3,"When I saw pictures and read the details about this Plantronics Discovery 655 DSP Bluetooth headset I just knew I would have to have one.  I have owned several Bluetooth headsets in the past, most made by Motorola, and I have always continued looking for something that would stay in place and sound good to both myself and the people that I call.  I just can't seem to find a Bluetooth wireless headset that shines in all of the important areas.  They either fit lousy or sound lousy or both!  This new headset from Plantronics looked to be the answer to my search for near perfection.  It is very lightweight, fits snug in my ear, and has a very impressive appearence.  It even comes with a multitude of charging accessories, to allow you to charge from a standard 110 volt household outlet, charge from a USB port on a home or office computer, and even charge from a single AAA alkaline battery.  The headset provides very good tonal sound quality to the user and the sound output is quite good for the person on the other end of the conversation.  What more could a person want from a wireless headset?  How about decent phone to headset reception?  Even with my Motorola Razr V3 and Razr MaxxVE cellular phones clipped to the belt around my waist I still experience constant reception problems.  There is noticeable crackling and popping sounds and sometimes brief cutout of the conversation.  Although the people on the other end of my conversations say that they notice only slight flaws in the sound, I find the amount of noise in the reception to be distracting and very annoying.  The proximity of my phone to the headset doesn't seem to be the problem at all.  Most of the time the headset is less than 3 feet from the cell phone it is paired with.  I have tried the headset with both my work phone and personal phone, as well as with my wife's phone.  Changing phones has no effect on the reception problems.  To add further frustration, the headset does not work properly with the voice-dial feature of my phones.  All of my previous Bluetooth headsets would allow you to push the call button, which would prompt the cell phone to activate the voice-dialing feature.  This Plantronics model requires you to manually activate the voice-dial feature from the telephone itself or to punch in the phone number yourself.  This really prevents me from using the headset as a safer means of calling from my car while traveling.  I constantly receive compliments from friend and coworkers regarding how sleek the headset looks.  But that just doesn't offset all of the shortcomings this headset has in terms of reception and functionality.  The Plantronics Discovery 655 has a great look and an abundance of ""extras"" that are included in the package.  However, if you are looking for reliable Bluetooth headset that will offer great sound and above average reception then I would recommend that you look elsewhere.  I still give this item an overall rating of 3 stars because of its design, lightweight, comfortable fit and variety of charging options.  They just need to give it better compatability with hands-free voice dialing and much stronger Bluetooth communication with the cell phone it is paired with.","07 27, 2007",A1ZM846Y7AUYD,M.

B000HBIUNG,"[7, 7]",4,"I needed a new bluetooth after accidentally leaving my HS850 in my shirt pocket just before the wash cycle began. The device I had before that, was the Cardo Scala 500. I'd bought that one from Amazon and wound up returning it due to low volume. The HS850 suffered the same symptom. I found myself constantly pressing the headset to my ear while I was listening and turning up the volume which caused a distracting echo for the person I was talking to.So, one of the features I was looking for was a device in which the microphone was not too close to the earpiece. The Discovery 655 seemed to fit the bill. I also read some good reviews on it. I was pleased when I first tried it on and found that it went right into my ear for a perfect fit. This is important for two reasons: 1) I wear glasses so, it's nice not to have to deal with a loop, 2) I think having the earpiece so close to my inner ear precludes me from having to turn up the volume. In fact, I haven't touched the volume at all. This is the first bluetooth device that I've been happy with right out of the box.

B000HBIUNG,"[69, 90]",3,"I purchased the 655 after reading a glowing review on cnet.  I had read a lot of reviews on multiple sites that indicated that a lot of bluetooth headsets didn't provide a clear signal.  Based on the cnet review I assumed the 655 was different.This being my first bluetooth headset, I'm not exactly sure what the standard is.  However, the Plantronics literature for this model clearly states that users will have ""33 feet to roam.""  In my experience, using a Blackberry 8700g, this is just false.  I get a clear signal 8 to 10 feet away from my phone.  After that the static kicks in and and increases dramatically as the distance increases.  Maybe Plantronics is just copying the hyperbole of other manufactuers.  Nonetheless,I'm not sure if I would have purchased this model if I had known that I was limited to 10 feet at most.With that said, I do find that reception is very clear within the 8 foot range.  Also, the volume control is excellent.  I found it easier to hear voices with the 955 than anything I'd experienced with a dozen corded headsets.The accessories are probably the biggest selling point.  The 955 comes with three earpieces and can be recharged via a AAA battery, USB or with a provided electrical adapter.If you're looking for a bluetooth set that provides clear reception beyond 10 feet (like they claim they're supposed to) then I wish you luck.  As of late 2006, based on reviews I've read, I wasn't able to find a single headset that gave that kind of reception.  It seems that bluetooth headsets are not yet ready for prime time.","09 18, 2006",A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,Traveler,"Great accessories.

B000JHKU72,"[1, 2]",4,"Finally, after 4 tries, I have found a set of bluetooth wireless headphones that I can actually live with.Are they perfect - NO!  I'll get into the pros and cons below, but first I've got to say that when I started my quest to purchase a decent sounding, less than a 100 lbs, and less than a fortune set of wireless headphone, I did not expect it to be this difficult.For my music source I purchased the Verizon ENV2, and added an 8 GB chip.I first ordered the JBL 610 ($125). While they paired up perfectly, they sounded much too tinny and felt cheap. Return # 1.Next I ordered the top-of-the line Sony DRBT50 ($165). These were light weight, felt great, and when I got stereo, they sounded wonderful. Unfortunately, they would not stay in stereo mode, kept reverting back to mono. Also, the controls were badly placed and I kept hitting the controls when I put them on. Return # 2.Next came the Jabra BT8030 ($137). They paired easily and sounded very nice (they have chip enhanced bass). Also - they turn into stand-alone speakers and they really sound great in that mode. The sound level actually doubles. Unfortunately, they weighted about a ton and I felt really stupid when I walked around the mall with them on. Oh yea, the ad claimed 32 hours of use between charges, but once I got them the specs said 7-8 hours. Big difference. I thought about keeping them for the stand-alone stereo - but - back they went. Return # 3.That's when I gave up and bought a pair of Bose wired headphone (the cheap $150 pair). They sounded great and lightweight - but once I got them on the plane I remembered why I wanted wireless phones. I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off. So after a couple of weeks of this, I decided to try one more time. I kept the Bose for the office.I purchased the Motorola S805, basically out of sheer desperation. They were only $88 at Amazon (I love Amazon!), and free shipping, so I gave them a try. Surprisingly, they paired easily and sounded really good.  They were not especially light weight, but fit fine on my head and were not all that heavy (8 oz). No glitches the first 3 days, then all at once I went to turn them off, and they went in pairing mode and the only way to get them out was to plug in the charger. A couple of more days went by and one morning they would not turn on (had plenty of charge). So I decided they were defective, and I sent them back and got a replacement pair. After about 3 days with the replacement set, once again they went into pairing mode, and then later would not turn on. Hum, if it happened the same way twice, then it probably was not a defect but something I was doing wrong. So I experimented with them for a few days and figured it out. Here goes: If you follow the instructions when turning them off and wait until after all 3 flashing lights before releasing the on/off button, they will go into pairing mode. If you release the button as soon as the first flash happens, they turn off. A quirk, but, given my history and desperation, not all that hard to live with. Next, why would they not turn on sometimes? I found this one by accident. I went to turn off the headphones, but forgot to first press the music play/stop button, just turned off the phones. That did it, they would not turn back on until I plugged in the charger and ""reset"" them. Okay, for most people that would be enough to ""send them back"" but I really want wireless headphones so I am keeping them.A few other observations:(1) I tested the charge time and so far they've gone 16 hours on a single charge, and they were still working. They are rated at 17 hours. Charge takes almost exactly 3 hours.(2) A big pro is the case, hard shell and very nice. Room to store the charger and supplied wired cable.(3) They transition seemlessly from stereo headphones to hands-free phone headset. When you hear the ring tone, just press the Phone button and you are talking. Clear as a bell. Not sure how my voice is coming through, but have not received any complaints so I assume it is clear as well. When you are finished with your call, press the phone button again, and you are back to music in a couple of seconds. The music is paused so you don't miss a note.(4) The ad says they reduce noise and echo, but I did not find either of these to be true. Background noise is not noticably reduced, and there is a noticable echo when walking in the mall. Does not really bother me, but you should be aware of this. Haven't tried them on the plane yet.(5) Controls: I like the placement of the controls. Took me only a couiple of days be become an expert at lowering or raising the music volume (a wheel), skipping or repeating a song (a different wheel), pausing (quick push of a button), or answering the phone (quick push of a differnt button).Okay, that's about it. I will keep them and I do recommend them if you don't mind dealing with a quirk or two. Besides, $88 (now $79 I see) isn't all that much money to be the first on your block to own some new high-tech gadget.","07 13, 2008",A4391PDC1HCB6,Bruce Whitehead,Forth Time's A Charm,1215907200,Motorola S805 Bluetooth D.J.

B000JHKU72,"[2, 3]",4,"My purpose for buying the S805 headphones was to hook them up to my Home Theater so that I could watch movies, hear the PS3, and listen to music all in one place.Most of the other reviews cover the product fairly well, so I will mention the one thing that made a difference for me: the Bluetooth transmitter.I had the Jabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor (A120s) and figured since my Motorola S9 Headphones worked fine with it; then these Motorola S805 headphones should work fine as well. I was wrong. After spending close to an hour of transfers, hang ups, and poor English, I finally got an answer from someone at Motorola's support line: ""The S805 is not compatible with your transmitter."" I asked them in return, ""do you sell a transmitter that will work with them?"" for which their reply was, ""Only one that works with an iPod.""So, I had to find another alternative. Someone here at Amazon mentioned in their review that they used the Sony Bluetooth Transmitter Adaptor (TMR-BT10A) with success. I broke down and ordered this, investing more than I had intended, but was pleased to find that the Motorola S805 headphones indeed work with this Sony Transmitter. I haven't used it much to do further testing, but it seems to work fine at close range; walking out of the room cuts the signal in and out, and if it totally drops you have to re-sync it. But I'm usually sitting on the couch, less than 10 feet away, and so far it works like a charm.So to sum-up:1) Jabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor (A120s) = does not work with the Motorola S8052) Sony Bluetooth Transmitter Adaptor (TMR-BT10A) = does work with the Motorola S805If there are others, I'm not aware of them.Other things to note on transmitters:1) My Bluetooth dongle on the computer did not connect these headphones either. My understanding is that you must have an A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) compatible dongle for it to work.2) The PS3 may have connected the device, but I didn't try as after some research, I learned that the system does not play game sounds and music through the Bluetooth connection. It is only good for talking back and forth with other gamers. Hopefully Sony adds this feature in the future.","01 7, 2009",A3AG5QAT8L0I3R,J.

B000JHKU72,"[3, 4]",3,"Pros:* Nice sound* Good feel on the head* Rotating cups are nice for mixing (during practice, not live, see below)* Headset comes with a really nice carrying caseCons:* They are extremely difficult to pair with any device. Every time I use them I have to spend five to ten minutes just trying to get the headphones into pairing mode and to actually pair with the host device. Motorola used the horrible ""one button does it all"" interface for operating power and pairing, even though there are two buttons on the headset.* The other button on the other side of the headset is useless because it's proprietary.  It's supposed to pause/play music but it doesn't work with any device I've ever paired the headphones with.* The little rubber flap that covers the USB and audio input plugs is always falling out and hanging lopsided.* The headphones say on the package and in adverts that you can connect a headphone cable to another device to listen instead of using Bluetooth, but they don't tell you that the cable has to be Motorola's ""special"" headphone cable, which you have to order from Motorola.  You can't just go to the store and buy a iPod headphone cable to use with the headphones like you can with most other devices.*The fabric on the inside of the headband is nice for keeping your head from sweating but it causes carpet burns on the back of your neck if you wear the headphones around your neck.*Not recommended for DJs (trust me, I am one) because you can never be sure how long the battery is going to last, as there's no battery meter. You really don't want your headphones to quit on you in the middle of a live show.* When the batteries get low there's a series of three beeps then an ear-bursting *POP* noise.  I wrote to Motorola to complain and ask if the issue could be fixed, but they responded by sending me another set of the same headphones which had the same problem. The only workaround is to quickly jerk the headphones off of your head when you hear the three beeps to avoid hurting your ears with the loud pop noise.* There's a really bright LED light that fades on and off while the headphones are receiving audio that you can't disable, on each side of the headphones.  It's kind of neat for about the first five minutes then it gets annoying.* The minimum volume is still sometimes too loud.* Default volume at power on is always too loud.","06 5, 2008",A7829CRHD25WU,"Majik ""FTW""",Good Sound Difficult to Operate,1212624000,Motorola S805 Bluetooth D.J.

B000JHKU72,"[0, 0]",5,"I was looking for a decent and cheap set of bluetooth headphones for my Macbook Pro and came upon these. After reading some of the reviews, I thought it wouldn't be such a bad buy considering the price. As the title says, these headphones do not work well with a Macbook Pro. Sure it will connect and everything, but the bluetooth setup that apple has on these laptops suck. I mean, the sound has a lot of static and cuts out. I'm not sure if its OSX that's the problem or the bluetooth radio but all I know is that the sound coming from the headphones just did not sound nice. At this point I wondered if it was the headphones or the computer. So I switched to my Compaq running Windows XP and lo and behold it sounded incredible. No static, no cutouts, nothing. The sound was crisp on both bass and treble songs. It was easy to connect and was running A2DP. I can bet that most people who rated these headphones poorly either had a non A2DP compatible source or was using a Macbook Pro. So even though I enjoy my Mac, all I can say is that apple skimps out on small things like bluetooth and to some people that means a lot. Overall the headphones were comfortable and felt very solid. The charge time is long (3 hours), but is definitely worth it. I have yet to try these with a A2DP cellphone so sorry if I don't review call quality and such. Even with my problem with my Macbook Pro, I thought that it wasn't the headphone quality that affected the sound, it was the computer and that shouldn't affect the overall rating of the headphones, so I rated these 5 stars.Pros:Cheap!Sound is impressive on both treble and bass.

This latter item item didn't score well with other Amazon customers--proof that you can't always trust the ratings.In the case of this ""Universal Car Vent or Dash Mount Holder,"" you can trust the consumer ratings--in fact, they may even be a bit high. The device is branded as a ""Cellet"" universal mount in the title, but in the description it's referred to as a ""Luxmo"" universal mount.  No matter. A poorly designed piece of plastic is--by any name--a potentially useless piece of plastic.The idea here is that you can, if you choose, unscrew the base and toss it so that it's not in the way of the bracket, which you then are supposed to insert in any convenient ""vent.""  Unfortunately, my air vents were either too narrow or too wide to accept the bracket, or ""Vent Mount (non)solution.""  So it was on to Plan B, the ""Dash Mount"" solution (at least it's a versatile little fellow).  But the base for this kitschy piece of curious clutter is no more than a single square inch.  Moreover, I had kept the unit for over a year before deciding to give it a try.  So not only was the sticky substance spread over too small a foundation: it was no longer sufficiently sticky to hold in place my iPod Touch even if the surface area were a whole foot!Here's where I was spared the worst nemesis of every neophyte--i.e. making a bad thing worse by trying to make it better.  In other words, I was about to get out the Crazy Glue and muck up my otherwise clean dashboard when it struck me that maybe I ought to see if this ""adjustable"" guy actually would clasp my iPod as advertised.  Upon pressing the button for releasing the spring and extending the gizmo's right arm, nothing happened.  His right arm was jammed (and the left is clearly non-adjustable).  Since he obviously needed a helping hand, I gave him one.  Unfortunately, my gentle tugging  pressure was enough to snap off that piece of plastic on the right side of this holder with the (non) ""Adjustable Grip.""Mercifully, the experience came to an end before I'd given this low-(but over)priced imposter a chance to show its stuff.

Supcase had a similar product too, but the back was clear.So I took a chance.  This is a very attractive case on the One.  The black trim on Silver back provides a nice contrast.  There are cutouts for everything except the volume buttons.  I tested the volume buttons first since some cases make it difficult to press the buttons.  No so with this case.  Very easy to press.The cutout for the rear facing mic leaves plenty of room between the mic and cutout (the mic is perfectly centered within the cutout).  The bottom mic is a bit off-center within the bottom cutout, but it's far enough from the material.  Cutouts for LED and rear facing camera match the pics that accompany the product description.  Cutouts for power/IR and headphone jack are centered.Case is very snug (I like that).  Bumper provides a nice grip since it is textured.  There is a good sized lip on the case that will protect the screen when placed faced down on a flat surface.Once concern with other brands is that the hard material sometimes separates from the TPU material. I'll update the review in a few months after I use this case for awhile.This case replaces a Cruzerlite Bugdroid Circuit ""Clear"" case... mainly because the Cruzerlite's idea of ""clear"" is actually frosted white.

These things are like armor for your phone. I have dropped my phone, sat on it, threw it and all kinds of stuff while it had an Otterbox on it and never had a scratched added to it.The problem with this &#34;Defender&#34; series is the screen protector portion. See, getting this thing apart to put it on requires supernatural skills - the same amazing skills are required to get it off once it's on your phone as well. So, yeah, before I could even get it apart to put it on the phone, my finger went through the screen protector, so that part was broken.It takes a little doing to get it on your phone. Maybe it's because I'm not actually a superhero, but after a little grunting and a lot of cursing, it was on. I snapped the screen on it and the rest of it and.... then decided to see how well I could get it off.Hahahahahaha... a bloody finger and more curse words later, it was off.It's on there now and I do have a regular peel and stick screen protector on it, so I never bothered to pick up one of the spares you can buy.It's a GOOD case, don't get me wrong. I have never used the clip that you can optionally use with it, but it looks like it's good quality as well.However, if you do not have Hulk hands, you might want to look at another Otterbox series. This one means business and I don't want to end up with stitches every time I need to open it up to take out a battery or whatever.So, I love Otterbox. I will continue to buy Otterbox. But I will NOT be buying this series. I'm also thinking that when I buy a new case, I should probably just buy a new phone too because I'm not sure I can get this thing off again. *laughing*Recommended for those that need series protection for their phones and don't have a need to swap the case or remove it.","06 26, 2014",AG2YXYIQ8TLTA,"CandysRaves (and Rants) ""CandysRaves""",I love Otterbox.

B000NLSGA2,"[73, 77]",5,"I was a little hesitant at first when ordering this case due to the fact that the defender cases have been super bulky in the past. Much to my surprise, Otterbox and their Defender Series Cases have come a long way since I contemplated ordering one a few years ago. This case is extremely thin for the protection it seems to offer. The build quality is superb and should protect the phone very well! I love the built in screen protector as opposed to trying to line up the sticky screen protectors with a few of the cheaper cases. The price seems fair as well. I paid $49.95 on Amazon. If ordered directly from Otterbox it will cost around $10 more.At the time of this post, the Lifeproof Case for the s5 has not been released. A huge deciding factor in choosing Otterbox over Lifeproof is the mixed reviews the s4 Lifeproof Case received about echoing when people try to talk to you.The belt clip seems to be nice and lock the case into place, but realistically I'll never use it. I keep my phone in my pocket. The buttons seem stiff, but from what I've read it's common at first on Otterbox cases.Overall, this case is a little pricey costing about 25% of the phone's cost after a contract renewal, but I feel it's definitely worth it (especially when you consider the alternative is paying full price for an s5 because yours broke in the middle of your contract). Lifeproof will cost you about $20-$30 more.I'll try to update this review accordingly as time progresses!*****UPDATE: 7/8/2014 - I've had this case for a little over 3 months now and I still really like it! I've only taken it off of my phone 1 time since purchasing (to clean the dust out and reset the phone by pulling the battery). It was very easy and quick to remove. This case has definitely protected my phone against my toddler's destructive ways on numerous occasions. The only problem I've noticed is that sometimes the case's buttons will slip off of the phone's buttons when I try to adjust the volume. It's not a big deal. I just hit the button again until it works correctly.The screen protector is still smooth and my finger is able to glide across it effortlessly, which is nice since I am addicted to my phone and use it almost nonstop.I've talked several coworkers and friends into purchasing this case.

I wouldn't say it exactly looks good though.  If you've had an Otterbox, it looks like the rest, you're sacrificing appearance and size for protection.  I got it mainly because it comes with a belt clip, and the GS5 is a pretty big phone to carry in your pocket, especially as the days get warmer.It seems to attract and hold dust a lot.  Perhaps lighter colors wouldn't show that as much.  Personally, I find that big chunk of rubber protecting the headphone jack unnecessary.

B000NLSGA2,"[1, 1]",5,"I've used Defender series cases on two Sammy S4s (mine and wife's) and my older 4th Gen Ipod Touch. I couldn't be happier with how they have worked. One minor flaw is that you have to be quite careful with the hard case snaps (slotted slip overs). They are easy to break. With such good luck on prior Defenders, I decided to get one when I upgraded to the Galaxy S5.The good news: same rugged quality of construction on the S5 Defender case.The REALLY good news: when I added the Samsung OEM wireless charging back cover, I managed (with some effort and a small compromise) to get the Defender case to fit over the slightly larger back cover. It isn't perfect, but it is serviceable. The snaps don't fully engage and there is a tiny separation at the bottom  (where the wired charging port connects), but, the case is held securely in place by the rubber/silicone wrap around. From the front, top, sides and back, the case looks like a perfect fit. All buttons and openings line up just as they should. Only by looking at the bottom do you notice the fit isn't perfect.The Bonus: The Samsung wireless charging adapter charges the S5 IN THE DEFENDER CASE!This is the unit I purchased on Amazon:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F358AVI/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So, the combination of Otterbox Defender/Samsung Back Cover/Wireless Receiver/Samsung Wireless charger, work very well together, with the slight issue of the case not fitting perfectly, but workably.

B000NLSGA2,"[0, 0]",4,"I want to like this case as it has what I am looking for in a phone case. It has complete protection for the screen and the phone itself without the need for a separate screen protector. The case has 3 components to it, the hard plastic inner shell which prevents any immediate damage to the phone itself. After the hard plastic casing is in place, the softer rubber part of the case fits over that and snaps into place better than some less expensive cases I've tried. The feel of the softer case is great, you will not feel like you will drop the case once this is installed. If you have small hands, and can hold the S5 by itself, with this case you may not. This case adds a lot of width to the S5, which was already a big phone and almost makes this as big as the Galaxy Note with this case on. I can still easily access the fingerprint scanner, camera, speaker and USB plug. The buttons remain responsive and easy to click on both sides. I use the headphone jack quite frequently, so I would have to assume that continually removing the flap to access the headphone jack might cause it to wear down over time. The front portion of the case has a significant border that keeps the phones screen from being anywhere near the surface underneath it, but again, this bulk is noticeable. I prefer to use a phone case that has a belt clip available and the belt clip that comes with this case is very sturdy. The phone clicks solidly into place and is unlikely to accidentally fall out while on a belt. Overall this case does have everything I'm looking for: protection, added grip, and a belt holster. The added bulk however is a concern for me that even with larger hands it does change the size of the phone in a noticeable manner.","06 22, 2014",A2GSJUETASGMO0,rose thyme,Everything adds Bulk,1403395200,Otterbox [Defender Series] Samsung Galaxy S5 Case - Frustration-Free Packaging Protective Case for Galaxy S5  - Neon Rose (Whisper White/Blaze Pink)

Being a hater of wires, I went looking for wireless headphones, and kept finding that the ones that rate well for audio quality tend to be ridiculously expensive.  I ran across these on Amazon, and decided to give them a whirl, even though they seemed too cheap (as in inexpensive, not poor quality) to be any good.I'm extremely glad I took the chance!  They have great sound, good volume, and great battery life.  I only have to charge them once a week (I listen probably only a couple hours a day, and not every day, so take that for what it's worth), which is great.  They also do a good job of isolating you from the outside world, and likewise, do a good job of keeping your tunes from bothering other people.If I had to pick out any issues with them, I'd say that they could stand to allow for bigger heads - I have them extended out as much as they will go, and they JUST fit.  I guess I am one with a big head :).The only other issue I could pick out is that the on-board controls are a little hard to pick out while wearing them - they are small, somewhat flush, and close together.  Still, I've gotten pretty adept at controlling my music with them.I have not tried them for phone calls - I tend to like to use the phone directly while at work, so I can't say how well the microphone performs.Overall, I'd say these are a great find, especially when you consider how expensive wireless headphones tend to be.

B000PCCLPU,"[4, 4]",4,"UPDATE 11/23/2010: The DRBT50's now have more (and less!) functionality when used with the iOS 4.2+ software. You can now change volume for the headphones using the onscreen volume sliders (previously the volume bar changed to say ""DRBT50"" and you had to control it using the headphone controls). You also have the option to output sound to either the headphones or ipad speakers (a new toggle icon appears when the headphones are on) which is nicer than having to turn them off completely to use the ipad speakers. You can also go to next/previous song using the built-in controls. You still need to press the play/pause button for them to connect, unfortunately (other bluetooth devices connect instantly when turned on).Unfortunately, this comes with a huge downside.. videos default to playing audio through the ipad speakers. If you listen to music through the headphones and a music video comes up, the sound will come out of the ipad (you need to go into the controls and change it every time one comes up!) Even worse, other sounds such as those from games also default to the iPad speakers.. but have no option to output to the headphones (which previously worked perfectly). The downsides far outweigh the positive additions in this case, and it's something that needs to be fixed.Original review:I picked up the DRBT50 headphones for my iPad, mainly for peace of mind. I like listening to music on my iPad, but find my headphone cord always ending up in the wrong spot - getting stuck in my chair or wrapped around something. I get that ""If I had just rolled my chair out, the iPad would've gone crashing down"" feeling. Whether it's with short cords or long ones (long cords have the problem of being too long!). I wanted a wireless option that had great sound but didn't break the bank.The DRBT50 has been the closest to that, that I've found.Pairing is rather quick  (but you will need to read the manual on how to do it). Unfortunately the iPad doesn't automatically connect to it - this means that you not only need to turn the headphones on, but connect them in the Settings -> Bluetooth option. Annoying if you walk out of range or connect/disconnect the headphones all day. (UPDATE: I found that hitting the Play/Pause button on the headphones will connect it to the iPad without having to go into the options!)Battery life is very good and a charger is included - unfortunately it's an AC Adapter unlike the mini-USB port that most use.The headphones are very stylish and fold up very nicely (a big problem with the other headphones).The controls on the side are a nice idea, but more trouble than they're worth (at least to me). They're small buttons and I always find myself hitting the wrong one. Most of them will NOT work on the iPhone/iPod/iPad (only the VOL+, VOL- and Play/Pause buttons work). No big loss since the controls are so hard to find (they're behind the ear). (UPDATE: The buttons have gotten easier to find after further use - still not the easist, but definitely do-able (especially for volume)When paired with the iPad, it ""takes control"" of the volume (so you need to use the iPad to change the volume). See the product image I've attached to the item page.Sound is very good - I've heard complaints that it doesn't block out noise as good as it should (while I don't use it in the loudest places, I found it to block out most noises - not ""noise cancelling"" though). Bass could be better, but overall not bad. Not up to par with mySennheiser HD-595 Premier Headphone, but it's also a third of the price and bluetooth.I would have liked a headphone input jack for those times you want to use it with a non-bluetooth device (like a home theater).I havent used it as a headset yet, but heard it does a decent job.Overall a very good product and possibly the best bluetooth headphones available in this price range.

This is a MAJOR plus, and the main reason I bought it to begin with. It simply works!* Volume is LOUD! In those noisy environments, this is a plus, and I usually have to turn it down to mid-range, even in noisy areas.* Unlike some, it is very comfortable to me, for long periods of time, and I wear mine for hours at a time. Lighweight and small...compared to my Motorola H700, it's heaven. I forget it's even on sometimes.* I love the quick disconnect, reconnect feature using the volume up/down buttons.  I use it with two phones (Motorola V325 for work and Blackberry 8700c for personal), and this makes it a breeze to switch from one to the other without having to fumble through the phone menus.

The Blueant Z9 is extremely lightweight and small. This makes it very comfortable, feels secure and does not flop around. The sound is loud enough that you do not have to increase the volume. The voice quality is clear and consistent. I have it paired with a Nokia 6555.Now for some details. The Jawbone is by far the best for handling noise cancellation. However, the voice would sometimes be garbled or breakup. The Z9 does a good job on noise cancellation and the voice stays clear and does not breakup.There are three buttons. The function button handles most features. There are two volume buttons for up and down. The volume buttons also have functions such as holding down the volume up button for three seconds actives the redial feature. This may sound confusing, but it really is not. You just need to read the instructions. The buttons are easy to press with little resistance.The Z9 has a large speaker so there was no need in the design for an ear bud that directs the sound into the ear. It also has two microphones that help improve voice quality for the person you are talking too.The noise cancellation defaults at minimum. In noisy environments, simply click the function button. A voice tells you that it is set to maximum noise cancellation. That is really a cool feature because you do not have to figure out what the beeps mean.The range is as advertised. I walked away from my phone by about thirty feet and still had a clear connection. Therefore, you do not have to place the headset on the same side or close to your phone.I looked at my phones paired devices and noticed I had firmware version 3.1. I went to the Blueant site and downloaded the instructions and installation program for firmware version 3.4. I could not get the installation to work, so I called tech support. He told me that the instructions online were for Windows XP and I had Vista. He said that they have not posted the instructions for Vista online yet. He promptly emailed me the Vista instructions. They were detailed and precise. I upgraded the firmware within a few minutes without any problem.Helpful hint: To get the best sound qualities, speak in a normal voice, not too loud. In addition, update the firmware to the latest version.I highly recommend you try this headset for yourself.Update: I have read that the ear hook is made of stiff plastic that cannot be bent. This is not entirely true. If you want a tighter and more secure fit then do the following. While holding the hook in the bent position you want, hold a hot hairdryer about two inches from it for about five seconds. The hook will stay in that bent position. Just be careful not to bend it too far or the hairdryer is too hot or too close to the hook. I did this with my hook and it fits much better, even with my glasses on.","01 31, 2008",A2PL4KZQJ0VFOB,"D.

I had a few bad experiences with Bluetooth early on and felt that it just wasn't ready for the prime time.  A friend got an older Jabra headset and it was terrible to talk on--static, breaking up, muddy speech--I basically REFUSED to talk to him while using it.So it was not without trepidation that I pulled trigger on this little fella.  I am impressed!  The highest praise I can give is to say: IT. JUST. WORKS.  You take it out, charge it and pair it with your phone (Palm Centro, no problem at all).  In seconds I was using it and it sounded GREAT.  Both my wife (an occasional Luddite) and good friend said that it was actually BETTER than when I was talking on the handset regularly.  What more can you say?Very comfortable to wear, the buttons are easy and intuitive to press, and it seems sturdy (in part because it is so light, I dropped it but was not worried at all).  Yes, it is a little confusing to know when to ""click"" a button and when to ""hold"" a button for 3 seconds and which combinations you need to press, but for the basic functions it's pretty straightforward and only for fancier things do you need to memorize (or look up in the handy guide) the buttons to press.What about background noise?  It did a nice job on a windy Boston day and when you which to maximum voice isolation it does a remarkable job with cutting out background noise and music.In sum, this is a remarkable headset.  It is small, light, affordable, and really does the job.

It is better than all the others I tried, both in fit and sound quality.If you have a high need for switching between multiple devices, however, be aware that the advertised ""on the fly switching"" between up to 3 devices does not really work very well.The major shortcoming is that you have to completely turn off the current device (or its bluetooth radio) before you can switch to another device.  This makes no sense at all, since the Z9 has a button control for disconnecting from current device.Depending on your setup, this can range from a nuisance to a major roadblock.  For example, my setup is to use the Z9 with my laptop for Skype calls and my Blackberry for other calls.  I may switch back and forth regularly, depending on who I am calling.If I want to switch from cell phone to laptop, I have to complete turn off the cell phone bluetooth radio, which means the Blackberry loses all of its blutooth connections (including bluetooth synching to PC and modem use).  If I want to switch from laptop to Blackberry, I have to either turn off my entire laptop (it doesn't have a bluetooth radio off option), or remove the Z9 device from the bluetooth profile completely, which means I have to reinstall it from scratch again the next time.There is a new version called the Z9i, which claims to have better/more options for multiple devices.

The sound quality is great here with good bass.Pairing was simple. Just press the control button on the Cardo S-2 for about 7 seconds till you get alternating red and blue flashing lights and then go to your cell phone and ""add"" a ""new bluetooth device"" (make sure its in ""discoverable"" mode) with the 4 digit, 0000 passcode. Since my Nokia also supports the AVRCP profile, I'm able to control all the functions of the music player through pressing different parts of the Cardo S-2 headset. Moreover, the headset is very comfortable to wear, which is quite important.To get the stereo headset to work, I first press the control button on the S-2 for about 3 seconds till I see blue flashing lights. Then I go to the bluetooth section on my cell phone and connect it to the Cardo S-2. Now I can open the music player and listen to beautiful music.This headset comes with a hidden microphone. I've used it for voice conversations with my Nokia and it performs quite well. What's most impressive is that it easily switches from stereo to regular voice calling  seamlessly. I hear everyone well and they hear me well too.I paired the Cardo S-2 with my Fujitsu laptop, running XP Professional SP1, with the Widcomm software, version 4.1 and couldn't get it to work with Realplayer or Windows Media Player at all. I then tried version 5.1, but the result was not much better:  just a few sporadic sounds came out. However, when I paired it with the BlueSoleil software version 1.64, I got these headphones to work on my laptop. The music quality was good (but not as good as on my Nokia), but there were breaks once in a while in the music, which I never had with my Nokia 6300b. However, when I tried the software version 3.2 (Bluesoleil), the sound quality of the music was perfect with no gaps. The only remaining problem I had was that MSN Messenger and Yahoo Instant Messenger did not recognize the microphone on my Cardo S-2 (like my Nokia does). When I emailed Cardo's tech support and told them about this problem, I got this abstract robotic response blaming Microsoft's drivers. But I remedied that by buying the tiny $5 Labtec Mic 333 and plugging it into the microphone jack of my laptop's sound card.I bought the Cardo S2 to use primarily with my Nokia so I am very happy with it. With my Nokia 6300b, the Cardo S-2 deserves 5 stars.

B000UBNFT2,"[82, 86]",5,"The Plantronics Voyager 855 is the best gadget I own.I do not listen to music over bluetooth--bluetooth is simply too ""lo-fi."" It is mega-compressed and distorts your music no matter what fancy headset you get.However, it is absolutely wonderful for podcasts of AM talk radio. I listen to that stuff all the time--and now I can do it in any environment. Best of all in this type of application, you can remove the stereo earbud and you have a single-ear bluetooth cellphone headset that can also receive A2DP signals from your phone--the only mono device I'm aware of that can do this.The only time I attach the stereo bud is when I'm mowing my lawn and want the extra sound insulation. I use the triple-flange Etymotic eargels for it. It's a fight to get them attached, but the great sound insulation that results is an absolute wonder. Makes the noise of the mower nearly disappear, and lets me enjoy my favorite talk show at the time of my choosing, while getting actual, noisy work done.If you like to listen to talk but don't want to bother those around you who may not prefer it, this is an elegant solution. They just think you're a geek with a bluetooth on the side of your head, and you don't have to tell them you're listening to Rush if they don't want to know.And when a call comes through, I don't need to jam this thing further into my ear with the call button to answer it. I just extend the little mic boom, and it connects. Others mention that this action can pull the thing out of your ear. But with the Ety eargel it has a good snug fit that stays secure.My favorite sports podcast sounds better on this headset than it does on my car, even with its expensive Bose system. Same for every other radio show I download to my blackjack. How nice it is to hear a 3-hour show in just over an hour and a half with no commercials, and over my bluetooth to boot.As you may expect, I charge my 855 when I'm not using it. I've only had it run out of juice once, and that was after a very long session of listening at relatively high volume with the stereo bud in. It charges up fast, and goes for a longer time than it ought to. If you want to listen to podcasts on your mobile, this is the best piece of hardware out there to do just that.I couldn't get any of the included eargels to fit with this device, but with my weird-shaped head, that's no surprise. the Ety plugs are a lifesaver, and you can buy them in bulk from Etymotic so you can have a supply of clean ones.

I typically use it for listening to podcasts and audio books while I'm working, and for that purpose, it works wonderfully.  I've heard the sound quality isn't so great for music, but to be honest, my hearing isn't sharp enough to tell where it's lacking.My only complaints are with actual phone calls.  I've heard from people I've called that it picks up a lot more wind and background noise that my old Voyager 510 did.  There also seems to be a bit of a delay (less than 1/4th of a second) between when I start speaking, and when the mic starts picking me up.  It's fine if I take the time to speak clearly, but tends miss short, one word replies completely.","02 20, 2010",AIEPYQAN2ZAKL,DiscipleN2k,"Great for podcasts and audio books, OK for music and phone calls",1266624000,Plantronics Voyager 855 Bluetooth Headset (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)
B000UBNFT2,"[4, 4]",5,"The 855 package contains the headset itself, an earhook with secondary earbud attached, a worldwide charger, a neckband, and a little pouch containing additional ear inserts of different sizes as well as two plain earhooks (without stereo earbud wire).Even as a standalone mobile phone headset, the 855 is a spectacular value. It's small, sounds great and the sliding boom mike picks up your voice very well. Sliding the boom open when a call comes in automatically picks up the call, and sliding it close ends the call.The headset also features an action button, mute button and a volume control. Each action is signaled by a corresponding chime.Plantronics switched from their proprietary connector to a standard micro USB (the same as on the Kindle 2). The bundled neckband cleverly features a micro USB plug so you can easily attach the headset when not in use.If you want to use your headset in stereo mode (your device must support stereo bluetooth, of course, like most stereo telephones, iPhone 3.0, etc...) simply attach the earloop accessory and use the second earbud. Note that the stereo device does not have to be the same device as your phone: you could pair the 855 with your phone as a headset, and with your iPod Touch (with 3.0 OS) as BT headphones. If you're listening to music and a call comes in, you will hear the ring. Extend the boom to pick up the call, the music will pause and resume when you close the boom to hang up. How awesome is that?This headset is close to perfect and I found very few flaws with it:- Second earbud is fragile and cumbersome. It would be nice to have a better way to carry it, maybe something that would attach to the neckband.- Previous track/next track control is combined with volume+/volume- button and requires a long press on those keys. Skipping tracks takes 3 seconds, that's way too much.These are extremely minor gripes considering the excellent performance of this great headset and its remarkably low price. Considering it comes with Plantronics's spectacular customer service, there really is no reason to look anywhere else for a stereo bluetooth headset. This one is a winner.","06 19, 2009",AVPNQUVZWMDSX,"esanta ""esanta""",Inexpensive and feature-packed,1245369600,Plantronics Voyager 855 Bluetooth Headset (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)
B000UBNFT2,"[0, 0]",4,"This is a unique product.  It is a Bluetooth earpiece; it is a set of stereo Bluetooth earbuds.  It is one or the other depending on the ear clip being used.  The earpiece is designed to go into the right ear.  There is a standalone ear clip that allows the earpiece to function as a standalone unit.  The other ear clip is wired to an earbud that goes into the left ear and allows the unit to perform as stereo headphones.  Everything can be take apart and it will all fit into a pouch small enough to comfortably pocket.  The wire between the earpieces is sufficiently long to fit any head comfortably and is cloth covered.  There are multiple sets of earplugs so you can get a good fit to your ear.Either way, you have a decent-sounding (a little thin on the low end, though) headset that is suitable for most any situation.  The mic mini-boom does extend out if you need it closer to your mouth, but the mic is plenty sensitive (almost TOO sensitive as it can pick up a fair bit of ambient noise at times).  All the controls are on the right earpiece.  The only drawback is that the volume rocker pulls double-duty as the track forward/backward selector (you have to hold it down to engage this function, and sometimes I was unsuccessful in doing so).The fact that this is uniquely convertible is quite handy, but it does have a few limitations:- It is not very loud.  It depends on the phone being used with it, and with some phones, you may find yourself plugging your left ear so you can hear the conversation.  Note though, that using the left earpiece will help with this.- The charging port is a MicroUSB, rather than the MiniUSB that is found on most headsets.  There is a charger included, but if you want to use a regular home or car charger, you will have to buy an adapter ($5~8).- When the battery is low, it will beep at you every 10 seconds or so, which gets annoying quickly.- I haven't had problems with the ear clips, but they do not look terribly sturdy.If I could, I'd honestly give the product a 3.5-star rating, but I will round it up to 4 just because this is a handy package to have.","04 7, 2011",A3URMIVRQLZVMO,"Funky D ""FunkyD""","Certainly not perfect, but very handy",1302134400,Plantronics Voyager 855 Bluetooth Headset (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

The best feature of the Voyager 855 is the wrap around earbud feature which gives you true stereo sound.  Th wrap around cord and earbud are detachable from the headset by pulling out the adapter and over the ear clip.  There are four sizes of earbuds included which is a plus.  Once you get used to pushing the earbud in - the ambient noise just disappears.  Pairing is easy and I have paired with both Iphone and MacBook Pro with no difficulty.  There is a slide-out feature to the headset which is really beneficial when there is any wind. My friends say they my voice is much clearer when using the slide out feature.Overall this is a great product.  I do find I have to push the bud in the ear at times, but I think that is more due to me trying to determine what is the best size earbud.  The only downfall is the distant between iphone and headset is WAY less than advertised.  When I get around 10 feet from my iphone, I start dropping signal if I turn my head wrong or go around a corner.  I usually keep my iphone in my pocket or on the counter or desk where I am working so it isn't much of a problem for me.  I bought this as a goldbox value and I have not been disappointed.

I wanted a cheap black case for it.  I wasn't too concered with protection or whatever - just something to cover it.  This one looks good.  Look at the pics - looks nice, right?  Wrong!It's a cheap piece of bended metal/plastic.  My phone fits in it - kinda - but it sure doesn't feel secure!  It's like a rounded piece of plastic - whereas your phone, if you'll observe it - has SQUARED edges!  The part that really bugged me is that it doesn't fit snug AT ALL: See the main photo here?  The one where you can see the back of the phone?  See how that apple symbol on the back of the phone lines up nice and flush with the back?  that is a LIE!  It's not flush at all!

Could be a seller mistake, but since it's in my favor, I won't complain. I wear hearing aids, so I had to get something that would work with a T-Coil loop. I have a non-powered version that is strictly for listening. The fancy one I purchased from the hearing aid manufacturer amplified everything, so it didn't function as I needed. This works perfectly. Only amplifies what is being piped through without adjusting the volume of the hearing aids themselves. Perfect for gym use and while working in the yard with over the ear protection. Basically, it works.Now that I've had the Jabra awhile, I wanted to update my review. I use it primarily with a Music-Link Stereo Hearing Aid Compatible Headset (http://www.amazon.com/Music-Link-Stereo-Hearing-Compatible-Headset/dp/B0030C3IFY/ref=sr_1_109?ie=UTF8&qid;=1394029299&sr;=8-109&keywords;=t-coil+loop). Since I already have a T-Coil bluetooth loop that works for handsfree driving and the like, I wanted something that would allow my use in the gym. The ComPilot is awesome, except that increasing the sound does so by increasing the hearing aid volume. The Jabra (on the other hand) does exactly what I wanted. So, it increases the sound of the music and leave the overall hearing aid volume in place. It's a perfect combination for my needs.","01 24, 2014",A2YXKWRDT3J2C8,"Amazon Customer ""Recent graduate New York Ins...",Does what it claims,1390521600,Jabra BT3030 Bluetooth Stereo Headset (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

The earbuds are designed to loop behind your neck, which is at first a bit odd, but makes a lot of sense.

B000XT3L7W,"[2, 2]",5,"I bought this for a specific purpose, not it's primary intended purpose.I bought it to use on my motorcycle for the voice instructions from a TomTom GO 720 GPS. I really like the GPS, and use it a lot in my car, but its output options for audio on a motorcycle are really limited. It does do bluetooth, but only to a device that self identifies as a 'HiFI stereo device'. Helmet-ready 'HiFi stereo' kit is seriously expensive, given the need for sound isolation (=earplugs). The Jabra BT3030 works perfectly for this application. The supplied earphones provide sufficient ear-plug effect, and are comfortable for long periods (hours) under a helmet. They also provide good quality stereo sound. For me, for this application, this is an excellent, sensibly priced solution.The Jabra is also an excellent handsfree phone headset, and also is excellent at playing music stored on my phone's SD card, and though I never felt the need for either of those functions before, having tried it, I shall be using it for both.The only 'problem' is that all three devices are 'too smart' for me to be able to use all three functions at the same time. All three devices can connect to two other devices simultaneously; the phone to the headset and the GPS; the GPS to the phone and the headset; and the headset to the phone and the GPS. And all have logic allowing a signal on one input to intelligently overide the signal on the other input. So if I connect them all at once, the GPS gives me navigation directions, which the headset picks up, but the phone also detects the directions, decides that they need to be passed on to the headset (since the phone is not 'in use') and repeats them about a quarter second later to the headset, The headset starts relaying the instruction from the GPS, then gets the instructions from the phone, decides a message from the phone overides an (assumed) 'music input', and overides the GPS instruction with the same instruction a quarter second later from the phone, but only during the actual words, it flip-flops back to the other signal in the silences between words! The result is what I can only describe as a 'stuttering echo' or an 'echoing stutter' :DSince I don't want to talk on the phone while I'm riding, I just switch off the phone while riding, and switch off the GPS and switch on the phone when I stop riding. Works for me. :)If you wanted to do all three at once, I'm not sure even the expensive gear could solve that problem...","09 11, 2009",A2I4LS3L2EFG3J,Brian Henderson,Excellent for a sensible price,1252627200,Jabra BT3030 Bluetooth Stereo Headset (Discontinued by Manufacturer)
B000XT3L7W,"[9, 10]",5,"I love the BT3030. I use it with the Jabra A120s on my iPod as well as with my Cyber Blue Bluetooth USB dongle.With the a120s I get about 40 feet away line of site (cubicles) or less than 20 feet through standard home walls. With the CyberBlue dongle however, I can use it all the way into the restroom which is over 60' away & through 2 walls & a bathroom stall.When paired with the A120s you can only control the volume, but with the dongle I can play/pause & skip forward & back.I use this with my Oticon Tego P hearing aids & it works so much better than my Eli bluetooth adapter. The Eli would last MAYBE 1.5 hours for music, a bit more for talk. The BT3030 lasts about 5-7 hours depending on the volume I have it set to. It's really no larger than a real dogtag at 5.5cmlx3.5wx1cm thick.Being so small, it hangs from a ball link chain (see pic) or from your zipper if you want. It charges via a USB adapter. Linking it with the a120s is NOT mentioned in the documentation, but here's how it's done:1: turn on the a120s (make sure it's plugged into your audio source)2: turn on the BT30303: wait about 20 seconds.4: that's it.For bluetooth phones or PCs it's only slightly trickier as you need to use the password which is ""0000"" but once they are paired up, all you need to do is select ""connect"" on the device to be listened to & then turn on the BT3030.Even though there are bluetooth headphones out there, I like the BT3030 because you can use it with ANY headphone that can attach to a 3.5mm jack. In my case it's my hearing aid, but you can use your favorite set.The ONLY downside to it is that you need a usb to charge it and you can't continue using it while it's charging. But it's a minor complaint. I Also think it'd be nice if it had a user replaceable battery.For phone use it has a small microphone in the top.

B0011G9LCU,"[1, 2]",3,"I wanted to like these headphones and I tried everything to no avail. The title to this review summarizes these headphones.  That said, let me start with what I did like:Pros:-Good design, the mic is on the left side, so you never have to wonder which side is right, and which is left.-The mic is separated from the answer button, this is great as it keeps the mic small so you don't have a large piece of plastic hanging off your ear.-Very stylish and sturdy (though I didn't care for the carry bag much).-Stop/Next/Answer button works perfectly.-Cord extension is great.So far so good.  Now for the one con: audio quality.  The bass is non-existent.  I have owned canal earphones before and I know what a good seal feels like (so fit was not an issue).  I also tried all three silicone pieces before settling on the mid-sized piece.I also burned the headphones in overnight as maximo recommends, but still mediocre bass.I also tried setting the EQ on my iPhone to ""Loudness"", but that did not help.  I'm not a bass head, but I do like solid bass response and was quite disappointed.Outside of the bass issue, i also found that there was focus on mid range without great highs (i wonder if this is to emphasize audio conversations, but I can't say for sure.Finally, the design of the silicone eartips doesn't not create a good seal.  You may have a different experience with your ear, so take that with a grain of salt.My last set of headphones was made by skull-candy and i found the earpieces there to be much better.In the end, I sent them back and am looking at ultimatebuds fs1.","08 14, 2008",A20W55PTAUBWZK,Ali,"Good design, mediocre sound",1218672000,Maximo iP-HS2 iMetal Isolation Headset

In addition to in house chargers, I put a car holder in my vehicle in the lower left corner of the windshield and hid the cables under a dash mat to the stereo.  The install was fairly simple since I could place the antenna outside and fish the thin cable through the hatchback, then put the flat panel booster behind the phone mount with the amp under a seat.PRO :  comes with all antennas and proper terminationsPRO :  new flat antenna works with phones that no longer have a car adapterPRO :  switch is on the cigarette lighter plug if your lighter is always hot and you need to turn it offNOTE: Phone needs to be secured into a mount, with the antenna close behind.  With the laws being passed about no one handed driving on the cell, most people have migrated to a mount simply to comply - the inside antenna works well in this case.RESULT - installation was simplenitpick - LED for being ""on"" can be hard to see - its visable at night but in full sun hard to tell.  Not an issue since the lighter sockets get turned off when the vehicle is off.nitpick - DOES NOT send 4G LTE signal through (700 mhz) but that signal seems to be stronger than the 3g signal anyways.Verizon has alot of CDMA handoffs that are strictly cell to cell.  CDMA was designed so that a soft handoff could be made using both cells, and a 3rd to ensure no dropped data or calls, but I have not seen that feature used and experienced calls where one side was dead or where alot of cutouts happened in the mountains.  Now I have 4 bars/4 100% of the time - before it would drop to 1, 2, 3, or 4.  My vehicle telematics system is on ATT and shows its signal strength on the display when using it - seldom does att achieve even 2 bars here, and their antenna is external built into the car!  The ATT network has several times been unavailable for car data which seems to correspond to people who have iphones on verizon vs ATT - same phone, but terrible experiences w/ ATT.  It is unfortunate you do not have 2 real options with att and verizon due to ATT's weaker signal.  When cellular was first planned it was a duopoly with 2 options.  Now with PCS competition and confusion as to roaming on pcs you end up with one strong carrier nationwide.  Original analog cellular phones could be moved between carriers but today the phone is almost disposable since verizon and att chose incompatible digital systems.I have used wilson equipment since the analog days - on an offroad trip years ago to the middle of Nevada with no service, I was able to stop and make a call using the wilson amplifier and a high gain directional antenna to a cell site 83 miles away in Bishop, CA.  I dialed *611 and asked the technician what city I was in - not the usual call - he told me I was in Bishop, CA and I explained I was dialing from the middle of nowhere, NV 83 miles east of Bishop (their cell site was high up in the mountains and we were in the flatland - combined with the amplifier and high gain antenna I had full service camping at night)I have found wilson to be a quality brand that stands the test of time and recommend them to friends who live way out there.","10 2, 2012",A203OCQQ12MAVT,"HMMWV ""God, Country, Corps""","Great kit, ships complete, deals with newer phones that lack external antennas",1349136000,weBoost 3G Wireless Cellular Phone Signal Booster Kit for Vehicle - Smart Technology Amplifier Kit

There is no doubt that in at least some scenarios like these, the device will improve the signal to the point where you may be able to make and keep a call.This device is not a silver bullet, but it can help in certain scenarios.","10 13, 2011",A2EMM9HWOSY2Q5,Jemmie Wang,Works in certain situations,1318464000,weBoost 3G Wireless Cellular Phone Signal Booster Kit for Vehicle - Smart Technology Amplifier Kit

B0012OP7HE,"[22, 24]",5,"I have to admit, I was a long time believer in the law of diminishing returns and did not believe in buying high end electronics for a very small incremental return. We held out against HD TV until our old TV died.  When we finally got HD we were amazed so much we ended up rewatching nearly our entire DVD collection to see everything we have been meeting.I had the same reaction when I first tried these ear buds. I was amazed at the sharpness of the high tones.  The first song I listened to was the dresden dolls and I could make out every drum beat and each key stroke on the piano rang out.  I really was like HD audio without any changes to the media or ipod. It took a while to be able to just be listening to music again, I was so impressed by the clarity.There were two big reasons I wanted these head phones. First I wanted to be able to listen to my Ipod touch on my bus commute without having to crank up the volume.  This worked perfectly, I can now greatly reduce the volume and get far more clarity than I was getting before with the buds that came with the ipod.  Watching movies is also far easier now because the isolation makes hearing dialog much easier.  The second reason I got these was to use with the upcoming iPhone 3G.  I am looking forward to using it when I get one.Here are the Pro's and Con's as I see them.ProsThese have by far the best sound I have ever experienced in headphones. They are comfortable, or at least after a couple of days to get used to the feel of them.  Once properly inserted, I had full mobility with no fears of them slipping out.  I was worried about replacement covers, but then I looked into the box again and found the two bags that contained dozens of replacement covers - very nice touch.ConsThese are the first isolating headphones I have used.  It does cause some strange internal sounds, like if you try to eat while listening to music, the chewing noises are very loud (kind of like chewing with your fingers in your ears.) Also there is some noise that gets transmitted from the cords into the ears. Also, they seem a little overpackaged, or at least the version I got. I still feel a little uncomfortable with the price, $180 is steep for me, and now that I have tried them, I'm not sure if I can go back.  But the quality covers the price difference, as well as the few cons I can think of.These are truly great. Much like the iPod it's revolutionalizing my listening experience.

They fold up to almost nothing in the included carry pouch, though it isn't quite as protective as Shure's Kevlar case that comes with an a cord spool built in as well. Before getting this earbud/headset, I primarily used a Shure earbud that retailed for around $100, I believe it used to be called the e2, but it's no longer made. It has slightly clunkier, but longer cord, and the earbud/driver units are larger. I have to say though based on my tests so far, they have similar sound and both block out sound well. I could see that the HF2 would be handy to have as the only earphone/headset/earbud for Road Warriors or someone that wants to get one good set of earbuds to use on an iPhone, iPod, Touch, or other Mp3 players and cell phones.

B0012OP7HE,"[4, 4]",5,"I've been using the Etymotic Research ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones for over a year now and have totally loved them, so I was very excited to try the Etymotic HF2's to incorporate them into cell phone/music player scenario.  I'm even happier with the HF2's.One concern that I always have had with the ER6i's is that the cable always seemed like it could snap away from the earbuds.  Now, that has never happened to me in the year of constant use in New York City - but still, they seem fragile.  The same connection in the HF2's has been redesigned and now it looks very sturdy.  The wires are connected to the earbuds by a sturdy rubberized-plastic anchor piece, built right into the earbud housing.The cord is about six inches shorter than my ER6i's, but is still plenty long to have the phone/player tucked in my back pocket.  Wires seem sturdy and is one solid cable all the way down to the male plug, which looks cleaner (instead of two smaller cables stuck together like the ER6i's).The voice/microphone hangs at just the right level to my mouth and works easily.  There is a little 'bump' switch that sticks out and you use that to activate the mic and take/hang up on calls.  Works exactly as it should and you don't have to worry where it is . . you just put your thumb there and trust that it will 'click'.The sound is fantastic - nice and clean.  I know these might seem expensive, but if you love music and don't want to destroy your ears with overly cranked audio - then invest in a good pair of earbuds.  With these isolator type earbuds, I can totally hear everything in the music - even on the subway - and keep the overall sound level down.  I probably listen to music at less than half the volume on these earbuds than most people do with regular earbuds - and have a much better listening experience.My first pair of high-end earbuds were the Ultimate Ears super.fi 5 Pros.  Those were great, but I did have a problem with my first set and had to get a replacement pair.  Those also suffered from the same disconnection, cable to earbud, and I stopped using them.  They had a great sound -nice and full - but I always felt like the earbud was too big and heavy, and wrapping the stiff cable around the back of my ear was a bit much.My second pair of high-end earbuds were the ER6i's - great full sound, very bassy.  Nice and light, easy to put in and remove, and have proven to be very sturdy (I'm pretty rough on equipment).The HF2's are the next step in audio for me.  The sound is extremely clear and balanced.  In some ways the bass isn't as big as the ER6i's- but I think in the better way, meaning the overall sound is more accurately representative of the music.  It's like there's more presence to the sound, meaning I can listen to things even quieter but still enjoy hearing every instrument or nuance to a song.  The bass end has more clarity rather than pump.Overall, I love 'em.

One pair of foam seals is included, which may block off more noise, but I prefer the triple flange seals.The wires are thick and stiff enough to untangle easily. There's still the bassy, scraping noise whenever the wires brush against something, e.g. whenever I move my head, but that's the case with all earphones, I guess. But how does it sound?As far as I'm concerned, they sound great. Whether it's Bach's violin concertos, Gluck's Dance of the Furies, Dire Straits, Johnny Cash, or Jefferson Starship, the audio sounds true, that is, the instruments and voices sound natural.

I use it very little for music but extensively for watching movies, shows, etc. The stock earbuds are pretty awful as we all know, besides medicore sound quality they are just so uncomfortable so I was on the look out for something more comfortable for myself and something with great sound for my husband who uses his ipod touch every day on his 1 1/2 hour commute to/from NYC.What we ended up with was a pair of these and a pair of the vmoda'sV-MODA Vibe Earbuds - Gunmetal Blackwhich retail for about $100 less.I had already decided these would be mine, as I said he's the audiophile but strangely doesn't mind the stock earbuds and didn't care what he ended up with. I was so excited when they arrived, I had already tried out the vmoda's and really really liked them and assumed with the $100 price difference these would be that much better.Love ended quickly, I thought it was to difficult to put them in my ears (pull your ear up and out with one hand, twist in with the other) sure it blocked out the outside sound but in a ""head underwater in the bathtub"" manner, the sound wasn't clear and true but muffled to me, and no bass... just none. I tried all the different size fittings, tried putting them in different ways (yes I tried a very deep tight fitting, still awful), tried different songs. I was in disbelief so I grabbed hubby and made him try them vs the vmodas, he agreed instantly that the vmodas were infinitely better. I did find if I gently (not pushing so much as just barely touching) held my finger tips to them when they were in that the sound was much better, but I'm not going to use them with my index fingers in my ears. Maybe I got a bad pair, maybe my ears just work better with the vmoda... whatever the reason I wasn't impressed with these and feel that the $100 you'd save by getting the vmoda's could be applied to a new ipod or lots more music from itunes.I didn't have the chance to try them out as a phone as I don't have an iphone, and I'm not sure if the double click to advance songs only works on an iphone, it didn't work on my ipod touch (would have been a very nice feature if it did).The case these come with is nice though, for what that's worth.","07 4, 2008",A3R7RE5O61M112,@homemom,"I want to love them, I really do... but I hate them!",1215129600,Etymotic Research ER23-HF2-BLACK Earphones/Headset--Black

So I will endeavor to only mention that even the smallest isolation baffles Etymotic Research sent with the headphones hurt like all heck.The sound they produce is actually quite good (once I figured out they basically have to be way INSIDE your ears). The mic isn't the best I've ever seen. It is very subject to wind noise (I walk a lot).

B0012OP7HE,"[0, 0]",5,"I'm on long flights often, and a few years ago I got a Bose Comfort 2 headset -- the expensive set with noise cancellation that sits on your head as though you were a pilot instead of a passenger.  They work well on a plane where there's a steady low frequency drone from the engines, but they're bulky and after a couple of hours the squeezing pressure began to bother me.  I switched to a Sony in-ear noise suppression headset, which is small enough to fit in a pocket, but neither the sound nor the noise suppression came close to the Bose, probably because they didn't stay in my ears very well.So... in a never-ending effort to acquire more headsets, after reading a very positive review in the Wall St. Journal I bought the Etymotic HF2.  Unlike the Bose or Sony headsets, the HF2 delivers isolation rather than noise cancellation.  Therefore it doesn't need batteries to power the noise cancellation circuitry.  The earpieces fit tightly but comfortably into your ear canal and they block noise.  That means they work not just on a plane, but also in a noisy environment where there are sounds with mixed frequencies, not just the low frequency of aircraft engines.  The HF2 has the added advantage of having a microphone for taking calls on an iPhone, which is a nice bonus.  Your own voice sound kind of muffled and distant because of the noise isolation, but it's something I got used to easily. The mic has a button that allows you to take the call without fishing the phone out of your pocket.The package includes four types of fittings so you can get the best fit for your particular ears.  The Sony came with three types, but none of them gave as good a fit as the Etymotic.  That fit is very important with the HF2 because unless you get a good seal the noise isolation won't be as good and the sound won't either.  You have to insert them well into your ear.  You can order replacement fittings from Etymotic at a high price given that the fittings are little bits of molded plastic or die-cut foam.  According to the Wall St. Journal review, Etymotic is going to offer custom made fittings for an individual's ears.The sound is quite good (based on listening to a variety of MP3 recordings on an iPhone and to an audio download on my laptop.)  The base sounds aren't overwhelming but it's certainly OK and the higher frequencies are crystal clear.  The noise isolation is superb, and maybe this is the last headset I'll buy for plane travel at least for a while.The package also comes with a couple of replacement ear wax filters and pocketable zippered pouch that's better than a draw string pouch because it stays shut.  Two cautions: If you want to use these to sleep in a noisy environment, be aware that the ear pieces stick out of your ears, so it would be uncomfortable to sleep on your side.  Also, don't wear these when you are driving, or at least leave one ear open because you won't hear horns, sirens, or anything a passenger says or screams.","08 28, 2009",A9J4UURM4OSDW,Michael Sandman,"Good sound; good fit, great noise isolation",1251417600,Etymotic Research ER23-HF2-BLACK Earphones/Headset--Black

B0012OP7HE,"[112, 117]",4,"You've seen those people with earphone-mic combos for those phones - you know, *those* people who walk around, holding the mic up to their mouth, who might as well pull out the earphone and just hold the phone up to their ear.  Are they uncomfortable, thinking that the mic won't pick up their voice, or are they compensating for a lackluster microphone?  If the latter, that will not be necessary with the Etymotic HF2 earphone headset, whose mic is every bit as strong as the one built into most phones, if not better.I tested this set with an Iphone 3G, and those on the other end were not able to guess that I was on a headset microphone rather than the Iphone's admittedly high-quality mic - that's a great compliment right there.  The mic, which hangs about three inches below the right earphone, seems to be able to filter out background noises, as well.  As for controls, it's simple - there's one button on rectangular microphone unit.  Press once to answer or hang up a call, twice to send a call to voicemail.As for sound quality of the headphones, they're fantastic, and that's no surprise given the pedigree associated with the Etymotic name.  I'm an Ety fan - I have a pair of Ety ER6i as well as their ""big brother"" the ER4P, and the sound quality of the HF2 ranks right around the ER6i, which should be excellent for most people.  Those not familiar with the ""Etymotic sound,"" it is extremely clean, and many may find it lacking in bass, but it is very true to the recorded sound, unlike many other cheaper (and sometimes similarly priced) earphones.  What you hear with Etymotics is a very accurate, if sometimes stark, representation of the sound that the artists captured.  They are not good headphones for those looking for huge bass response.  Those who enjoy jazz and great detail in their music might just love the Etymotic sound - they truly are an audiophile company.  And when it comes to calls, there's also a small thrill to be had that first time you talk to someone and hear them in stereo through these earphones if you've never experienced it before.  The world is blocked out due to the earphones' superior sound-dampening abilities, and the caller on the other end is extremely clear.A note about fit and sound quality: these in-ear 'phone are meant to seat deep in your ear, sealed with your ear canal.  When seated properly, they will deliver incredible sound quality and beautiful, solid bass - but not the deep, head-rattling bass you may be accustomed to from other head-and ear-phones.  If they aren't seated properly, wet the tip just slightly, insert, and then turn just a bit to get them ""snug down.""  The fit shouldn't hurt, but may feel odd at first.  I found it took some getting used to and, yes, you will likely notice some earwax - you are, afterall, closing up your ears, so they will get warm.  Clean the triple-flange tips from time to time and make sure your ears are as clean as possible.  It sounds like a ritual, but it really is worth it for the extrmely high sound quality these earphones are capable of creating.Other small details: where the two wires for the earphones connect to join into one is a slider to sinch up the wires . . . I assume if you want them close to your neck?  Included on the wire is a clip that I found more annoying and cumbersome than useful.  Thoughtful, yes, but not easy to remove, and I feared damaging the wire sleeve in doing so, so it stayed put.  It simply made winding the wires up to put into the handy zipped leather pouch a job a little more clumsy than necessary.  Also included are foam tips and smaller triple-flange tips for the earphones, replacement filters, and a filter replacement tool.For owners of the first generation Iphone, the headphone jack is sized to fit into the recessed jack - no need for an awkward adapter.So why only four stars if I enjoy these so much?  (It would really be 4.5 stars if Amazon would let me offer it.)  I balk a little at paying almost the price of the 8gb Iphone for a mic/earphone headset, even as high-quality as this one is.  Another thing, and this is true of any headset, and so I don't mark this one down for it, your speaking voice does not come through the earphones.  Normally that's not such an issue, but when you are listening to the other party in stereo, and you can only hear yourself as if through plugged ears, it's a little disorienting, and I found myself fighting the urge to speak louder.  It would be nice if there were some way for your voice to be able to feedback into the earphones.Overall, however, these are fantastic - miles above most typical headsets, but the price reflects that, too.  If you spend a significant amount of time both listening to music and talking on your phone, and you truly treasure sound quality, these may make perfect sense.","07 24, 2008",A1YAGM2QOSAAOT,Personal Robot,"Typical Etymotic sound quality, but a high price for a mic",1216857600,Etymotic Research ER23-HF2-BLACK Earphones/Headset--Black
B0012OP7HE,"[1, 2]",4,"I have have purchased two pairs of these headphones in the past 3 years.  The first pair was replaced twice through the warranty.  Both times it was for the exact same problem: it would lose the sound in one of the channels.  This was caused by the weak connection between the 3.5mm jack and the cord.  If that cord got bent around at all, which is unavoidable, it would eventually short out one of the stereo channels.  Luckily the headphones come with a very good warranty and they replaced them both times.  The third time it happened I just bought another pair.On the the headphones performance: The sound is excellent and the noise isolation even better.  You can block out the rest of the world easily; which is very good since I ride a noisy commuter train every day.  The inline iPhone/smart phone controls work wonderfully.

B0012OP7HE,"[2, 2]",5,"I've been listening to my iPod for years with my old headphones. I've always been happy with them.When I got the these Etymotic Hf2's, I was a little dubious. I already had the iPhone bluetooth for phone calls, and  I was curious to how this would work, both for phone calls and listening to music.Well, I'm sold. What an amazing hearing experience. When I finally got the ear piece in correctly (and more about that in a minute) I couldn't hear anything around me. I put on the music on my iPod, and WOW. What amazing clarity. I know some people have had problems with the bass, but I wonder if  this may have been because they didn't have the ear pieces in correctly.These earphones are terrific, because if you are listening to music on your cell phone, and you get a phone call, the music automatically stops, and the phone call comes in - clear as a bell.Two things to note -First, is that because this earphone blocks all outside noise, you really only want to put one ear piece in your ear while driving.Two, be very careful about putting in the ear piece - it's tricky! At first, I didn't look at the directions and just stuck the gray rubber ear piece end as far as it would go. Yow - that hurt. I thought to myself, ""Oh great, now you've done it, you've perforated your eardrum.""But I didn't, and when I switched to the blue tip, and held my ear out as demonstrated, it went in perfectly.Highly recommended.","06 30, 2008",A2GPJR489OIH42,sb-lynn,Fantastic,1214784000,Etymotic Research ER23-HF2-BLACK Earphones/Headset--Black
B0012OP7HE,"[2, 2]",5,"This is my second pair of noise isolating headphones and I have to say that my other pair pales in comparison.  However, it is important to note that they were a hundred dollars less and did not function as a hands-free headset either.Ease of use: These headphones were easy to install in my ear canal using the gray eartips (pictured).  There are six smaller blue eartips included as well as one set of foam eartips.  I pulled the top of my ear up (as indicated by the directions) and the eartip easily slid into the ear canal and sealed off all noise.Noise isolation: Remember when you were a kid and your sister was teasing you and you plugged your ears and said, ""I'm not listening!  I can't hear you! Ha, ha, ha ha !"" (I am sure there was a tongue sticking out too.)  These earphones gave me a flashback of those days.  When the music was off I could faintly hear my child standing in front of me talking, when the music was on (not loudly, but an appropriate level) I couldn't hear him scream... and he tried!  However, if you can remember back to being a kid you might remember that when you chewed or swallowed while plugging your ears you could hear every nuance of that sound.  This is true for the noise isolating headphones.  Of course the music will drown that out depending on your listening level.Sound Quality: WOW!  The sound is shocking!  You can hear every small detail and understand every word (which is typically a challenge with many singers)!  The sound is beautiful and was the way, I'm sure, the record company intended.  The bass was perfect for me.  It had enough ""bump"" for my tastes.  I am not one to drive down the street setting off car alarms with the bass bumping from my car BUT I also like a little extra bounce when I am working out to my music.  This is exactly where I found the bass to be, not flat, not headache inducing.Hands-Free Function: This portion of the headphones worked flawlessly.  I typically have a problem with headphones being too quiet.  Since these are noise isolating this is not a problem.  The microphone function is decent and while I typically like the microphone closer to my face, this headset is more of a ""headphones first"" ""headset second"" sort of device.While all of the above have been ""Pros"" the one ""Con"" I found: When using the HF2's with the Creative Zen V Plus the music would play, however, certain instruments and the vocals were lost.  It was like bad karaoke backup music.  By chance I pushed the send/end button on the headset and the music sprung to life.  When I let go, so did the vocals and various instruments.  I only had this problem with the Zen.  With my iPod and Zune there were no problems, only excellent sound.  Luckily the Zen belongs to a small child and I won't let him near my fabulous headphones!","07 5, 2008",A1QTHVA826XEOS,Super Mum,OH...So that's what music is supposed to sound like...,1215216000,Etymotic Research ER23-HF2-BLACK Earphones/Headset--Black
B0012OP7HE,"[2, 2]",2,"I have been a religious advocate of Etymotic canalphones since the original ER6 came out and I've been using a set of ER6i's for 3 or 4 years now.First the good: The HF2's are clearly superior to the ER6i's with a mellower, less shrill topend while still managing to retain crisp definition and equal or exceed the bass of the ER6i.  The HF2 still doesn't have the base of a Shure or Ultimate Ear, but overall I prefer the Etymotic sound.Then the not so good: Sadly at least on my BlackBerry, the microphone is terrible.  It simultaneously has low gain yet no sound isolation.  The people I call tell me that I'm muffled and hard to understand and I have to speak loudly to be heard even if I'm in a quiet location.  Forget being able to talk on these in the car or at an airport or when walking outside.  The people I call can only hear rushing wind or background noise.Another flaw is that the microphone hole is tough to get located near the mouth.  I find that I have to hold the mic up near my mouth and make sure it isn't twisted to point away.Then the terrible: I sent an email to Etymotic expressing my disappointment with the mic and asking if there was a chance that I had a bad microphone.  They never responded to my email.  I will try again, but so far I'm pretty disillusioned with the HF2.  I suppose I'll have to call them and try to get an RMA (I let the return period with Amazon expire.)","02 6, 2009",A21Y5X34AATMER,T.

B0012OP7HE,"[9, 9]",4,"I had owned my Shure E4c-n Sound Isolating Earphones for over a year when I tried the Shure SE530PTH with Push-To-Hear Control.  The difference was so huge and I just had to have them.  I use them mostly on airplanes (six flight segments last week alone) and I have been very,very happy with my purchase.I recently got a chance to own the Etymotic Research HF2 earphones and I am very impressed.  Here I will compare them to both the Shure E4c (which retails at about the same price as the Etymotic HF2) and the much more expensive Shure SE530PTH (around $500).The first thing that I noticed was that the Etymotic is thinner and more compact that either of the Shure models that I own. While the Shure is more ergonomic, they require you to run the wire behind your ear in order to get the best fit (at least that is what I have found).  I use the memory-type foam ear pieces on all of the models that I reviewed; they just work better for me and give me a nice, tight fit.  I like the Etymotic case better.  Although it is bigger, it is a soft case versus the Shure hard case and you can carry extra ear pieces in Etymotic case.I listen to mostly classical, jazz and opera.  I started this test with musical pieces that I was very familiar which; music which I've heard both recorded and live many times over the years.  I first listened with some inexpensive earbuds, the kind that come included with iPods and other devices, then with the Shure E4c-n. The cheap set sounded like I was listening to the music from another room.  I could hear it and recognize all of familiar parts, you just don't get anything close to the live music experience that you do with better buds. All of the exciting parts seem muted and dull.  The Shure E4c-n made a huge difference.  The high notes sounded crisp and pure.  The violins sounded like the real violins that they were, not synthetically generated ones.  Oboes, clarinets and tenor saxes had a clear, sharp sound to them (by the way, I have tried the $60-150 earbuds and, at least for me, I wouldn't buy anything less that the Shure or the Etymotic $150-200 models). Bass drums, violins and guitars stood out, had texture and shook you a little.Next I tried the Etymotics.  I have to admit that I liked them better, and not by a little margin.  Tenors sounded more vibrant with the Etymotics as did jazz guitar rifts.  Bass was a little better with the Shures, but not by much.  Plus, the Etymotics have the mute and call-switching feature that makes them useful to iPhone users (I used an iPod Touch for my tests). They felt better and lighter in my ear.Finally I tried the SE530PTH.  Yes, they are better, but it takes a picky ear to hear justify the $300+ price differences.  Plus, the Shures have a device with a built in microphone that lets you listen to someone talking without needing to pull your earbuds out (although I don't use it with my set, it's too bulky). If you have an iPhone, the Etomotics are a better choice as they have phone-useful features that the Shure doesn't.If I had the Etymotics first, I might not have bought the Shure SE530PTH.  Still, I am glad that I have all of them and I will certainly recommend the Etymotic to friends who are looking for a great set in the under $200 price point.Shure SE530PTH Sound Isolating Earphones with Push-To-Hear ControlShure E4c-n Sound Isolating Earphones (Black)","06 25, 2008",A17HMM1M7T9PJ1,Timothy B.

B0012OP7HE,"[3, 3]",4,"Let me preface this by saying I am an audiophile which is both a blessing and a curse.Before writing this review I listened to Citizen Steely Dan disc 2, the first album of Bruce Hornsbys Intersections, and Art Blakey is Jazz, Donald Fagens Morph The Cat, Gnarls Barkley's The Odd Couple and finally Scott Walkers Scott 3.  I have this to say -- The sound is great.  Its gentle, reserved, quietly confident.  I feel like I'm hearing the album and not my headphones interpretation of the album.  There are no ear-piercing highs, no earth shattering lows drowning out the signal, just competent clear reproduction of what the artist intended.  The sound opens up a bit at higher volumes like most headphones/speakers if you want something a little more punchy -- but for me, low volume.Etymotic really stepped up their industrial design design with this product.  The packaging is beautiful and so is the product.Now the downside.  The plug is a little too big, and the microphone at twice the size would still be WAY too big.  It dangles uncomfortably.  Compared to the apple microphone it is ginormous.  Getting the plugs seated in your ear is also difficult and because of this it important to note that these are headphones for sitting.  You wouldn't want to walk around with them.That being said, these headphones are great and earn 4 stars, my new everyday headphones, unseating my CX300bs.","07 4, 2008",A21KNRUAA5RK5E,Trevor Goodchild,A new love,1215129600,Etymotic Research ER23-HF2-BLACK Earphones/Headset--Black
B0012OP7HE,"[0, 0]",5,"I usually start with description of the package, but in this case I wanted to mention the actual mail box it came in with a distinct sticker stating their 30 years of Etymotic Research innovation. The box itself has a very premium feel and look that sets a nice tone for a product. After taking headphones out of the box, you can't help to notice how light they are - at 0.4 oz for headphones with eartips and in-line remote this is super light. You also get a premium soft pouch case, a shirt clip (a bit tough to remove from a cable though), a set of 3 additional eartips, and something very unique - a solid metal filter removal tool with 2 replaceable accu-filters that incorporate wax filters. Eartips are not your typical silicone domes you see with other brands. You get two pairs of triple-flange tips (in standard and small size), a pair of barrel foam tips, and a pair of mushroom shaped glider tips. Upon closer examination of headphones, you quickly realize why you need all these special tips. The pistol shape design of headphone has a very elongated ear piece that goes deep into your ear canal, thus a reference by some of calling HF2 headphones as canal-phones. Selection of eartips for these headphones is very crucial, you either get a premium audiophile sound or tiny stock earphone sound. I found foam tips to be too big, while gliders didn't stay secure in my ears although they were the most comfortable, and triple-flange were too uncomfortable although I probably going to use it later for my ear wax removal So what did I ended up with? I went back to my trusted Comply Foam tips. I had TSX100 handy which fits perfectly with these headphones. One word of advice since HF2 already has a filter with earwax guard, ""x"" model is an overkill since it has it's own earwax built in filter and HF2 earphone piece is long enough to pock it out, therefore TS100 model or T100 would be suited better.You do need to start with a proper burn in since these are armature drivers and out of the box you need to prep them to exercise the drivers (white/pink noise loop is the best for this task). A proper seal of your ear canal is the key to make HF2 shine, and I was successfully able to execute that with Comply tips. Once you get a perfect match - hold on to your seat because you are in for a real treat. The sound is VERY balanced, and by that I mean a super clean and transparent clarity throughout entire frequency range at all volume levels. I was able to focus on every detail of the sound, from warm and natural sounding low frequencies to a crystal clear and vibrant highs, and mids that very perfectly balanced in between without been too exaggerated or recessed. If you are looking for a ""fun"" signature sound with a typical v-shape EQ or if you are a basshead - these will not be for you unless you start tweaking the EQ. But if you want to appreciate the original content of the sound, if you care about the accuracy of how it's being delivered, and if you want to submerge yourself into one of the best passive noise isolation I have experienced - then by all means HF2 is for you. I quickly started to compare these to my other headphones, such as UE600 and S4A and M-Duo and quickly realized how far ahead they stand in sound quality. As crazy as it sounds, I actually compared these $99 (currently on sale at Amazon) to my $400 quad-armature driver UE900 and to my ears the mids and highs very pretty damn close. Of course, UE900 has 2 dedicated armature drivers for the bass only, and that's where it stands above HF2 but we are talking about headphones that cost 4x as much. I was also very pleased with a soundstage of HF2 where I felt precise placement of every instrument and it sounded very natural rather then too wide and exaggerated (even with crossfeed selected on my Neutron media player)..Without a doubt these have a superior sound quality, but it comes with a few additional surprise bonuses. I consider these to be audiophile quality headphones which often don't include in-line remote. In this case you get a very compact soft touch in-line remote with a single multi-function button and built in high quality mic. I found the remote to work perfect with my Note 2 and everything got executed as expected with a single button click to play/pause audio and video as well as pickup/hangup the call, double-click to skip next and triple-click to skip prev track, and long press to voice activate Google Now. I was very pleased with a distance of the in-line remote relative to my ear and how well it picked up my voice where people on the other end told me it sounds like I was talking right into the phone. Other important design details worth mentioning too. Earpieces have a very nice soft touch finish and a great strain relief which makes it very easy to handle these. Also, Kevlar-reinforced cables are tangle free and eliminate any microphonics effect. Furthermore, I really liked how it's 270 degree angled 3.5mm jack was easy to handle and protected cable from pulling. A special mentioning goes to included tool to remove accu-filter, something you would expect to be included with premium audiophile headphones at least twice the price. At first I thought that little filter was only used for its wax-guard, but after removing it and trying to listen without it - I definitely heard a difference where it sounded less harsh with a filter in. There is one more thing I would like to mention, and its AWARENESS! app provided by Etymotic to control a sound based on outside noise. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get it to work on my Note 2, although I know it works fine on iDevices. Perhaps it's still a work in progress and I will update my review later once I test a working version.Overall, I want to say that I just found a pair of my next FAVORITE headphones, that's how strongly I feel about these. For $99 we are talking about audiophile quality headphones with a superior accuracy and a very impressive passive noise isolation. With a bonus of in-line remote with mic and replaceable filter and 2 year warranty the value goes up. Just don't expect heavy bass and make sure to invest into comfortable eartips and you have a pair of IEM that compare and surpass quality of others which cost twice as much. Also, I hope in a near future to have an opportunity to test one of their premium ER4 models. If the sound quality of HF series stands that high, I can't even imagine how much you can improve it further.","10 27, 2013",A2DKQQIZ793AV5,Twister,Amazing audiophile quality at a fraction of the price!!!,1382832000,Etymotic Research ER23-HF2-BLACK Earphones/Headset--Black

Sliding it down also changes the display orientation from portrait to landscape; sliding it up switches it back.* Symbian S60 smartphone OS: In addition to thousands of available generic Java (J2ME) mobile applications, there are also nearly an equal number of native applications that can access additional functionality/hardware on the phone (for instance, there is one that uses the built-in accelerometer to control your computer's mouse cursor by simply tilting the phone, and another one that uses the built-in GPS to ""geotag"" pictures with your location as you use the camera).* Built-in applictions include QuickOffice to read Microsoft Office files (DOC, PPT, XLS), Adobe Acrobat Lite reader (PDF), RealPlayer (most media files/streams), home screen ""Search"" applet to search the Internet and local content, various organizer apps (clock w/unlimited alarms, phonebook with unlimited entries, calendar w/unlimited meetings, todos, memos, reminders..), calculator, unit converter -- you get the picture.  Notably absent, though, is a Timer/Stopwatch application; however you can easily download a third party one (e.g. from Smartphoneware).* Other S60-specific applications include Nokia's Internet Radio to stream live radio streams, ""RotateMe"" to automatically rotate the screen depending on your phone orientation, ""Fring"" mobile Skype/AIM/MSN/Google Talk/etc.. client, Google Maps with GPS support, Google home screen search applet, Mobile Weather app, ""ExtGPS"" to share the internal GPS information over bluetooth (e.g. to theNokia N800 Internet Tablet), YouTube player, emTube (also for YouTube access), etc.* One of the best mobile web browsers out there.  Based on AppleWebKit (a.k.a. KTML, the web engine used in the likes of Apple Safari and KDE Konqueror), it renders web pages ""as they were meant to be"".  And unlike that other phone that claims to do the same, the N95 also has a built-in Flash Lite player - so web pages that use flash will work as well.  Plus, you are of course free to download and use other browsers, such as the excellent, super-fast and bandwidth-saving Opera Mini (operamini.com).* Mail client with POP-3 and IMAP support (including IMAP-IDLE, a.k.a. ""push mail""; alternatively it can poll at specified intervals).* Mac OS X users: Although the phone does not come with bundled software for Mac OS X, you can download ""Nokia Multimedia Transfer"" (to synchronize photos and music with iPhoto and iTunes) and an iSync plugin (to synchronize the address book, calendar, todo etc) with your Mac - both from Nokia's web site.  Also, setting up your Mac to access the Internet via the phone (providing that you have a data plan, e.g. the $15/month ""MEdia Net Unlimited"" from AT&T;) is super-easy: When you first pair with the phone, the needed WAP/APN information is pulled automatically from your Phone's SIM card.  (Ironically, this works for nearly every phone, except Apple's own iPhone; this one has a very crippled bluetooth stack, and does also not support tethering).  UPDATE: I've learned that such tethering violates AT&T;'s Terms of Service.  Moreover, there are no  plans available for this phone (or most others) from AT&T; that specifically allow tethering.  If you do so anyway, stay under the radar, and don't abuse it - e.g. by using your cellular data plan as your main internet service.MODELS:=======There are 5 subflavors of the N95 released to date:* The original N95 (a.k.a. N95-1, a.k.a. RM-159) targeted mainly the European and Asian markets; while it had quad-band GSM (2G) support for use in nearly every country, including the USA, it had support only for the international W-CDMA (UMTS/HSDPA, a.k.a. 3G/3.5G) frequency (commonly referred to as UMTS-2100).  Nonetheless, this phone was later made available for retail in the USA as well, through Nokia's flagship stores, online site, and 3rd party retailers.  It had manual shutter lens protection (you would slide it open to start the camera), 64MB of runtime/dynamic memory (RAM), and a 900 mAh battery.  Common complaints about this phone was that it would often run out of memory when several applications were open, and that the battery life was too short.* The N95-2 (a.k.a. ""N95 8GB"", a.k.a. RM-320) increased the screen size from 2.6"" to 2.8"" (diagonal), increased RAM from 64MB to 128MB, increased the battery size from 900 mAh to 1200 mAh, removed the slider mechanism for opening the camera lens, replaced the SDHC card slot with 8GB of internal flash, and replaced the silver faceplate with an all-black design.  However, the bands supported were the same: W-CDMA 2100MHz, GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz - so although it will work fine with both AT&T; Wireless, T-Mobile USA and Rogers, it does not support 3G/3.5G network speeds in North America.  Nonetheless, as with the N95-1, Nokia has sold this phone in North America as well until just a few weeks ago; so possibly, this is the phone sold here (Unfortunately, Nokia's own sales channels do not normally make this distinction, and Amazon's product description is also somewhat lacking).  UPDATE: As the product description now clearly says, this is the N95-4 (a.k.a. N95 8GB NAM) model.* The N95-3 (a.k.a. ""N95 NAM"", RM-160) is the first model targeted for North America.  Most of the exterior design is similar to the N95-1 (Silver faceplate, 2.6"" screen, SDHC slot), but like the N95-2, it has 128MB of RAM, a 1200 mAh battery, and no manual slider for the camera shutter.  The main reason for its existence is that it swapped the original UMTS-2100 (WCDMA) frequency for UMTS-850 and UMTS-1900, so that it would work with AT&T; Wireless's 3G/3.5G network.  Until just a few days/weeks ago, this would have been the ""best"" choice for US customers.* The N95-4 (a.k.a. ""N95 8GB NAM"", RM-421) is identical to the N95-2, except that like the N95-3, it swaps UMTS-2100 for UMTS-850/1900.  It was released just a couple of weeks ago, though, so if Amazon got their inventory of ""n95 8gb"" devices from Nokia prior to this, it would have been the N95-2 rather than the N95-4.  (The exterior and labeling of both is the same).  Also, the firmware revision numbers are different, so some utilities (like the ""Nokia Multimedia Transfer"" application and iSync plugin for Mac OS X) do not yet recognize this phone. UPDATE: The N95-4 is now fully supported by most applications, including Nokia Multimeda Transfer and iSync plugin.* The N95-5 is for Japan; it is a stripped-down version of the N95-1 (e.g. no WiFi). UPDATE: As someone commented below, it is actually for China.COMPARED WITH OTHER PHONES:==========================N95 vs. iPhone==============This is almost an irrational comparison, given how different these devices are:* The iPhone is almost entirely about ""sex appeal"": Polished, slim, with a large screen for viewing content, multi-touch user interface (we've all seen how to zoom in and out using finger pinches, do inertial scrolling through a list of contacts, etc).  As such, it is very big on ""usability"".  The N95 is not even a touch-screen device.  (Personally I actually prefer ""hard"" keys w/tactile feedback; having used the touch-screen based Motorola A1200 MING in the past.  Touch screens are not very good for, for example, dialing a number without looking at the screen).* The iPhone feature set is, at best, mediocre.  Yes, it has WiFi - so does a lot of other phones.  Yes, it has a ""WYSIWYG"" web browser; again, so do so many others (including the 3-year oldMotorola A1200 MING, another touch-screen phone by the way).  However, it lacks: 3G support, GPS, Infrared, FM Radio, decent camera functionality (no flash, video recording, etc), 3rd party application support (e.g. no Internet Radio, GPS navigation, etc), or even a usable Bluetooth stack (to do silly little things like transfer files or enable internet access for a nearby laptop while on the road).  Even the otherwise crappy Motorola RAZR line (e.g. RAZR v3xx) do most of these things. UPDATE: With the release of the iPhone 3G and the new App Store, Apple has come a long way.  It's worth pointing out though that the iPhone can still not run standard J2ME/MIDP mobile applications, only those released specifically for the iPhone through the App store.  Per the Apple Terms of Service, this means: No 3rd party web browser (e.g. Opera Mini), no voice navigation, not even something along the lines of Nokia Sports Tracker (since it uses the GPS).* The iPhone is only available with a 2-year contract from AT&T; the N95 is only available SIM-free (unlocked).In short: The iPhone is about form, the N95 (and Symbian devices in general) about function.N95 vs.Sony Ericsson K850i===========================These are the only two 5MP camera phones available for the US market.  Neither of them is offered by a carrier (AT&T;, T-Mobile, Cellular One, Rogers...), so in both cases you will pay the full price for the phone.  (The upside, of course, is that you will not need to renew your contract to get it.. :)Also, both phones (in the case of the N95, some flavors of it) support the U.S. 3G bands, in addition to being quad-band GSM phones.  The difference here is that the k850i supports all four GSM bands and all three UMTS bands at the same time, so you don't have to pick a ""US"" vs. ""International"" flavor.  Finally, both phones have built-in FM tuners - though the k850i also supports RDM to display programming information transmitted in the broadcast.Most comparisons of these phones therefore center around the camera functionality (e.g. PhoneArena.com, GSMArena.com, and Mobile-Review.Com all have head-to-head comparison reviews of the two).  In summary: As far as camera phones go, these are as good as you get; they are both comparable to mid-range pocket cameras.  The k850i has an advantage indoors, because it has a real Xenon flash in addition to the LED autofocus assist beam.  However, in general, it has more ""washed out"" color reproduction than the more vivid N95; and it only supports video recording in QVGA (320x240) resolution compared to the N95 VGA (640x480).The main difference between the phones lie in other areas. The N95 is a Symbian smartphone, and so can run a whole slew of native applications specifically written for this platform, while the k850i is limited to running generic Java (j2me) mobile applictions.  Also, the k850i does not have a built-in GPS (but using an external bluetooth GPS receiver together with free GPS navigation software such as AmazeGPS, you can get voice navigation on this phone as well).  The Java version of Google Maps (which is what you would use on the k850i) has a ""My Location"" feature that uses information from cell phone towers to pinpoint ROUGHLY where you are, within a couple of miles; similar to the iPhone.  Various other limits exist in the k850i as well (1000 phonebook entries, 5 alarms, etc..)On the other hand, the k850i does have a few built-in applications that are notably absent from the N95: A flashlight application (uses the LED autofocus beam), mouse/keyboard emulation to control your bluetooth-enabled computer (e.g. for presentation), and a stopwatch/timer app.One last thing to note about the K850i:  Although it uniquely supports both U.S. and International 3G frequencies, its use on the AT&T; wireless network is sub-optimal.  That's because there is an interoperability issue with its built-in media player and the MEdiaNet configuration - so streaming internet videos (e.g. from YouTube) does not work.  This was the single most important reason why I ended up returning my k850i to the local store where I bought it, after having had it for about 2 weeks.N95 vs. the Samsung G810========================The Samsung G810 was announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February; it is another Symbian S60 phone with a feature set almost identical to the N95.  It will be sold internationally starting this fall; probably not in the U.S. though -- it is lacking the GSM 850 MHz frequency used here. (In other words, it is only a ""tri-band"" phone).  Maybe they plan on releasing a US version as well - I guess that depends on whether a carrier picks it up or not.Other than that, for better or worse the G810 has a 3x optical zoom. ""Worse"" because that inevitably leads to compromises in the optics (the thickness of the phone is the same, so that must mean that the CCD sensor is smaller - meaning more noise).  On the upside, it does have Xenon flash and a protective lens cap.Early available specs also indicate that it will have 96MB of RAM - midway between the N95-1 and subsequent N95s; however, the RAM will be split up into a 32MB chunk for the DSP (GSM and W-CDMA radios) and 64MB for the Symbian phone OS/functionality.  Thus, this could become an issue.For now, anther Samsung, the G600, although not available for sale in the US, seems to have a better camera (in some reviews outperforming the N95 and k850i), as well as quad-band GSM support.  (It is otherwise a low-end phone though, without e.g. 3G).UPDATE: Other Nokia Phones==========================Since the N95, several other N-series and E-series phones have been released by Nokia with very similar feature sets.  For instance, the N82, which features a full Xenon flash, and thus doubles nicely as a pocket camera also for indoor use (though the only version available does not support North American 3G bands, just like the N95-1 and N95-2).UPDATE Dec 1, 2008: The N95 now has a couple of worthy successors, each of which improve on its feature set in different ways: TheN85and theN96.  Personally, I'll stick to the N95 8GB though (see my N85 review to see why).","04 3, 2008",AU5V90NU1ON6O,Tor Slettnes,The perfect geek phone,1207180800,"Nokia N95-4 8 GB Unlocked Phone with 5 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, and Media Player--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)"

When I received it and put it together, I was disappointed.Allow me to elaborate...Griffin has a good idea here; instead of a goose-neck, it uses a ball-and-socket joint-type system of arms to position your iPod touch/iPhone.  The problem here is that you have a limited amount of positions to put your iPod in.Second, the suction cup is not as strong as it needs to be; it's a good idea on paper (instead of a snap-down toggle like most mounts, it's a screw-down type that should hold the suction cup more securely to the windshield), but the suction cup is very difficult to get to stick to the windshield, and you have to really press hard against it while screwing it down, and even then it would detach from my windshield at the worst possible moment (driving down the Garden State Parkway at 70 miles an hour).Third, it will not work with iPods/iPhones in cases...I don't want to have to remove my iTouch from its case every time I want to take it on the road.Griffin has a decent product here that just has a few problems that prevent it from being a great one.

B0014YJHNW,"[42, 42]",5,"This product works exactly as advertised. In fact, based on what I had read in the other reviews I would actually say that it works better than advertised. The suction cup works so well that the only thing I can figure is that the person that had problems with it did not understand how it worked. It is not the standard type of suction cup where you simply press it against the windshield and hope it holds. This suction cup works by placing it against the windshield and then turning the knob counterclockwise in order to pull the center portion away from the windshield. As it does this it creates a vacuum seal that so tight that you are more likely to dislodge the windshield than you are to remove this device from it.The iPhone fits perfectly into the holder and the aux cable is nice and thin. I actually used the phone in this setup when I wanted to have a conference call and the other person's voice coming out of the car stereo worked great for that purpose.The only caveat I would list is that if your car has a long sloping windshield you may find the extension not quite long enough to bring the phone within reach. You may be able to compensate for this by mounting it up higher. I drive a Jeep Wrangler and it has a pretty vertical windshield so I don't have this problem.","11 20, 2008",A34WRF3C70VMLL,frankfromnj,Absolutely Excellent Product,1227139200,Griffin WindowSeat Windshield car mount for iPhone 3G with iPod touch 1G Adapter and Auxiliary Audio Cable

I think it is unfortunate that certain people consider using bluetooth to be uncool and somehow associated with a rather hateful stereotypical image of a Hummer-driving yuppie. If you're driving and talking, GET a Bluetooth headset! I would rather see people driving around on the road like they are telephone tech supports than blind and distracted zombies. That ends my rant on why I believe everyone should be using a wireless headset. Now let's talk about this Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth.I've gone through a few Bluetooth headsets in the past few years - mostly Motorola and Jarba models priced around 20 bucks. I had absolutely no complaints regarding these economy models. When I received this 150 dollars headset(!) in the mail, I was seriously expecting to be awed and shocked with a level of performance, feature, and luxury I had previous unexperienced.The unboxing and setup process was pretty straight forward. One fancy feature that is indeed very useful is that a leather carrying pouch was included, and it isn't just any plain leather pouch either. The carrying pouch, in fact, has a built-in battery. When the headset is stored inside the pouch, you can plug in the charging cable and charge both the headset and the charging pouch. So later on, when you're on the road, you in fact have two batteries ready to be used which greatly extends the hours of use between charging. Unfortunately, the charging carrying case is the only positive thing I can say about this headset.According to the manual and the packaging, the headset supposed to have some fancy audio-processing logic which will make the phone conversation crystal clear. Alas, it was not the case. Once I got the headset bonded with my Verizon KRZR phone and made a test call to my wife, the voice sounded rather dull, down-sampled, and somewhat metallic. This is unacceptable for a 150 BT headset! I can honestly say, in term of voice clarity, all my previous 20-buck Motorola/Jarba outperformed this ridiculously overpriced headset by far. I have not tried the headset with any other cell phones. But a Motorola KRZR is a rather common handset, and Plantronics 925 gave me quite a let-down.In conclusion, I will not recommend this headset to anyone at its current price. If it was around $30 - $40 (currently Amazon is already offering at 50% off the original listing price), and only if looks/design is more important to you than voice clarity, perhaps only then I will recommend it to you.Sorry Plantronics, I honestly, genuinely wanted to love this headset. But for the time being, I'm going back to my 20 dollar Jarba.","06 6, 2008",A2RW587355CMVA,almosthappy,WAY overpriced. Math simply doesn't work out for feature:price ratio.

The reverse I have found to be true on many occasions with the ""over the ear"" design.Ergonically it is sound with the one large ""tap"" button for receiving and making, or even switching calls to voice mail. The other button is for volume which I have never needed to put on high as the audio is very clear, both receiving and on the other end for the recipient of your outgoing calls.6 hour initial charge is a good idea, and the addition of a USB charger to keep it at full capacity from your laptop or PC is nice, especially if you travel a lot.My only reservation is the snaptight leather ""case"" and charging station which I found fiddly to get the earpiece in and out of, and as the warning in the instruction manual states, can result in damage if incorrectly seated in the adapter inside the case. It ""looks"" good but really adds nothing and it's easier to charge direct from the transformer plug, or via the aforementioned USB.Overall a stunning earpiece, not as cumbersome or ugly as the ""Jawbone"" style of earpiece, and the clarity is equal to the more high end pieces, if not better.4 stars because of the funky carry case/charger and the high price. My advice, if you use hands free a lot, pay the extra, it will be worth it.","05 22, 2008",A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","Super clear audio, very disceet design",1211414400,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)
B001630QZE,"[17, 20]",5,"OK, I splurged. I usually don't spend this much on a headset. I've actually owned a ton of them over the past few years (check out some of my older reviews). Most of them were cheap sub-$30 headsets. Let me just say, ""I can't believe the difference.""After doing some research here and on Plantronics' website, I pulled the trigger. I'm using this with two phones; my Sony Ericsson W580i and my BlackBerry 8310.Pros:- First off, the sound quality of this headset is awesome. It is crystal-clear on my end and zero-complaints on the other. No more sounding like I'm in a tunnel. I assume this is the AudioIQ technology doing it's thing.- Secondly, the headset is super-lightweight and this equals comfort. I was skeptical at first about just popping this in my ear without a hook. Once I picked the right size ear-thingy, it fits perfect and I can barely notice it's there. Even after a few hours of wearing it (I know, I'm a geek) I barely notice it. I can do the ""shake-your-head"" test and this stays in place.Cons:- The charging ""case"" is cool, but I have a hard time getting the headset out of it sometimes. Thankfully, I can just plug the adapter right into the headset, bypassing the need for the extra bulk.- The price; but honestly, after spending more on a collection of ""less impressive"" headsets over the past few years, you really do get what you pay for.Highly recommended for it's sharp looks, perfect clarity and ultra-comfort.","06 6, 2008",A282RNKOO2P5RT,AreYouKidding?,"Fantastic, but pricey",1212710400,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

Basically can't feel it after either 2 minutes or 2 hours, which is good.- Bluetooth pairing easy, took four seconds.- Sound quality incoming and outcoming is very good.- Basics are: Tap to accept call, tap to disconnect.- Beyond the basics: A series of commands, tap, double tap, 2 sec tap, 4 sec tap, that doing different things during ringing, during a call, etc.  Confusing? Yeah.  Remember: Tap to accept, Tap to disconnect!- Bells and whistles: Comes with a case about 1x1x3"" that stores it and also has a battery and charges it during storage.  The case and the earpiece can also charge separately, and both AC and USB cables are included.I've avoided these because (a) no BT cellphone and (b) convinced they look stupid, all brands, on all people.

The sound quality is excellent from both ends; the comfort is the best that I have found over all others.  The earpiece is a soft rubbery piece that has a very soft, flexible extension that holds the earpiece in by the slight overlap of the natural ear cartelidge with very slight pressure.  While it might be uncomfortable to some if you were to leave it in for three or more hours; it is by far the best design I have found to date.  It also is the only headset that is held in perfect position by the earpiece; keeping the microphone end pointed perfectly toward the mouth at all times.  The only con that I have found is wind noise, in high-wind situations.  Something that could be easily fixed by a foam microphone cover if they would make one.  Even without this, it's still better on wind noise than all the other headsets that I have owned.  I have owned many Motorola headsets, the Jabra BT8040, the Samsung WEP200; and the Plantronics 510 Voyager.  While the battery life is not as good as some, (rated at 5 hours of talk time); Plantronics took what I think is the optimal solution by providing a battery in the charging case which provides another complete charge of an additional 5 hours without having to connect the headset to an external power source.  This gives you a usable 10 hours of talk time without bulking up the size of the headset to hold a much larger battery.","03 20, 2009",A1UWTC3CEDRTOQ,"David Schulman ""DS""",Best device on the market as of 3/09,1237507200,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)
B001630QZE,"[36, 43]",4,"The Plantronics Discovery 925 is designed to look cool -- as cool something stuck in our ears *can* look.  The features and accessories may boost the price, but for anyone who frequently uses Bluetooth headsets, these make the Discovery 925 well worth it, particularly since this device is extraordinarily comfortable for long-term wear.This is one of the few, if not the only, ear pieces that does not hook around the ear; instead, you press it against the ear canal, and it sticks, thanks to a silicon cover and stabilizer that comes in three sizes for individual fit.  I can shake my head and jump up and down with the earpiece facing the ground; it NEVER falls out.  The device is a breeze to pair since it automatically searches for available Bluetooth devices as soon as you turn it on.  There's a volume control (three stages only) and, of course, one touch button for calling and voice dialing.  The ear piece comes with three different chargers -- for wall outlet, USB laptop, and a carrying case that hold a one-time charge.  These charging options allow a variety of options for users who travel a lot or who use an earpiece for hours at a time.  Both the earpiece and the carrying case arrived fully charged, so I was able to use them immediately out of the box.The stated range of 33 feet was somewhat less, and I easily walked out of range more than once.  (My cheaper Motorola has greater range.)  The sound quality, however, was first-rate, although wind noise can be pronounced on a breezy day.  Because I can't get the 925 to work with my voice command feature on my Sony Ericsson cell phone, I used Plantronics customer service, both on the phone and live online.  While the service reps were pleasant, neither was helpful, although my problem may be too phone-specific for them to understand.  It is frustrating that it doesn't look like I can use this for voice dialing on a phone that was able to execute it using a Motorola device.Overall, this is an excellent product that deserves serious consideration from those who wear their Bluetooth earpieces for a prolonged time and who frequently travel with theirs.

B001630QZE,"[150, 155]",5,"I am a much heavier user of bluetooth headsets than most. My job requires me to spend long hours consulting on the phone, so a comfortable, reliable, BT headset that will last all day without a charge is a requirement for me. I typically buy a new cell phone every 6 months (Current is a Nokia E51, next will be a 3G iPhone :), and a new headset (I compared this one to a Jabra JX10 which I used previously) nearly as often. Some of my criteria may not be something you need, so keep that in mind as you read through,and as with any product, choose what features you will use, and which are ""cool"" but unnecessary.What's in the Box:-An extremely light headset (8 grams!)-Three ear pieces (small, medium, large)-Wall Charger-USB Charger-Nice looking Case that also charges the headset-Short, Simple, Clear Instruction ManualPros:Looks - The Plantronics 925 is a very attractive headset.  It doesn't have the goofy, bulky, flashy ""star trek"" look that a lot of headsets do.  The smooth, attractive lines, and the thin mouthpiece are very low key and elegant.  The headset also comes in 3 colors: standard black, fashionable gold, and feminine cerise.Charging - Plantronics included not 1, not 2, but 3 ways to charge this headset: through the wall, by usb, or with the extremely cool charging case. The case has it's own lithium ion battery, and it will actually hold a single charge for the headset without being plugged in. This means for an overnight trip all you have to bring with you is the headset and the case, and you'll still be able to recharge it once.Pairing - The 925 connected quickly and easily to my phone, this shouldn't be a challenge for anyone to do after a few minutes skimming the manual.Comfort and Fit - I prefer the ""in ear"" style of BT headsets to the ""over the ear"" style, so the 925's setup was great. The customizable earbuds should ensure a comfortable fit for most people, although there will be some who will experience irritation with all the sizes. The earbuds are a tad fragile, so be careful when handling them.Stability - The plantronics feels really light and loose, but it also stays in place! Nothing is more annoying than a headset that falls out, but this one does a great job staying in place.Range - The headset does well out to about 20 feet, any further and distortion begins to occur. Bluetooth is rated for 33 feet maximum, but in real life you will seldom get this far, and the 925 does excellent compared to other headsets.Sound Quality - The 925 does very well in this area. No one could ""tell"" I was on a headset, and both incoming and ougoing sound were crisp and clear for me and the person on the other end. The one exception was in wind, which I will discuss later.Battery Life - The 925 is rated for up to 5 hours of talk time and 7 days (!) of standby time, which is great for a BT headset. Although battery life does typically decline over time, in my experience it definitely lived up to the promise and I was very impressed by the amount of time I could go between charges.Cons: (Keep in mind these may not be important to you!)Controls - The 925 has 2 buttons: One large multi-purpose button on the side, and one smaller one on the top for volume. While the multi-purpose one is pretty standard (answering or placing calls, voice dialing, etc), the volume control is somewhat lacking. It only has 3 levels (high, medium, low) which it cycles through. This is in contrast to competing headsets (such as my Jabra) which have both ""+"" and ""-"" for volume, which can give more precise control over the volume.Wind Noise - This is something that is a problem on most headsets, and while this one did better than most low end headsets, it didn't do as well as competitors at half its price (such as the Aliph Jawbone). Such a pricey headset should not experience such bad feedback and voice choppiness when outdoors or on the highway.Price - The 925 is definitely on the higher end of the price range for BT headsets. The features for the price may or may not be worth it to you, and you could be just as happy with a much lower priced headset.Overall:Overall the 925 is a great looking premium headset which is packed with features. Comfort, ease of use, battery life, and sound quality were all excellent. The charging methods provided were exceptional, and the charging case is just plain cool. This headset is certainly better than most of the cheap headsets out there. Still, the price is high, and the controls and wind noise performance could be better. These aside, there is an excellent chance you will look great in and love this headset.","05 25, 2008",A3KZCNV1N8R9GC,diljs,"Light, Comfortable, Attractive, and Long Lasting - Almost a Perfect Bluetooth Headset",1211673600,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

I've tried a TON of different headsets, and all have paled in comparison to the 510. When I saw the 925 on sale (I'm talking 1/2 price here), I couldn't pass it up.PROS:First off - it's very high quality.  Well built, no loose parts, no falling off earpieces.  It has a CASE, and this case CHARGES the earpiece when not in use! The case holds one entire charge for the earpiece, so when you're in the car and your headset dies (happens to me ALL the time), you can charge it up and use it in no time!The sound quality is superb. I thought I'd never find anything as good as the 510, but this headset BEATS it! I literally did a side by side test with both of them. The other person thought that the 925 sounded MUCH clearer and more defined than the 510. Also, the wind is not nearly a factor as it is with the 510. You &lt;can> actually have a few weak gusts of wind while using it and still be able to be heard.It has GREAT battery life - this can be in standby mode for several days without needing a charge. I can talk and talk and talk and feel like I hardly ever need to charge it.Lastly - it's LIGHT.  MUCH lighter than the 510 - so light, in fact, that sometimes I forget that it's in my ear!CONS:OK, so there are many pros with this earpiece.  There are also a couple of cons. First - it's really, really difficult to fit the earpiece into the charger case. You have to adjust it so that it's perfect before trying to push it in. I fear that over time, the charger contact on the earpiece may wear out.Second - the earpiece insert gels don't really work all that great. Even though they include 3 different sizes, I couldn't find any that fit my ear perfectly. Therefore, the earpiece doesn't sit perfectly in my ear and forces me to turn up the volume (on my phone and earpiece) to the MAX. Still, sometimes, I have a hard time hearing the other person because it doesn't sit as close in my ear canal as others (the 510).Another con - comfort. It's comfortable, but not as comfortable as the 510. After about an hour, my ear starts to hurt from the insert. No matter which size insert I pick, I have the same problem.The last con - price. It's come down in price (at the time of this review, it's 72 dollars), but it's still too expensive. For that price you could buy two 510s and still have money to spare.That's about all the cons I can possibly think of.I'm a huge techie guy and love to try out all new technology. I've been fiercely dedicated to the Plantronics 510 over the years because I have yet to find anything that was better. In my opinion, the Plantronics 925 is better in almost every way than the 510.","05 28, 2009",A2FWZ58M6IQMD7,Doc Stew,I think I've finally found a replacement for the Plantronics 510!,1243468800,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

B001630QZE,"[0, 0]",2,"[Was Five Stars, Now Two]I have to admit that I have not always been an admirer of the venerable and ever-present Bluetooth headset. I have silently cursed at those whose self-importance required they stare off into space while conversing with some unseen counterpart. Another problem I felt was with the gigantic bug perched on the speaker's ear--it looked simply awful.The Plantronics Discovery 925 headset promised to buck the trend, not of speaking with the non-present but of drastically trimming and streamlining the size of that bug on the ear. As I needed a way to speak on my cell phone without encumbering my hand, I believed I needed to accept the inevitable and get one.First, I was surprised by how truly small the Discovery is! No longer does it feel like a crawling cockroach has gone to sleep on the ear but the tasteful design is, as the product brochure says, fashion-forward. It is light and sleek and even better, no flashing blue light broadcasting like a lighthouse either.Second and more surprising was how easy it was to setup. The adequate manual instructed that my cell phone needed to be in discovery mode and also what to do to achieve a pairing between the headset and the phone. I achieved this step rather quickly and easily.It was a bit difficult to know what steps to take next as I needed to focus on how to get it working after the initial pairing. I quickly discovered that through a confusing series of beeps, lengthy button pushes (the 925 has just one), and blinking lights of different colors, the headset is able to make and receive calls. A more careful reading of the manual showed me the error of my usual way of jumping into using electronics: after that, it was easy to know what beep meant what and what one or more colored blinks signified. Lesson: read the manual.The Plantronics came encased in a very nice carrying case which doubles as a recharging station. In other words, the case houses a battery which charges the headset if cradled. It also came with two ways of charging: a direct connection to a power outlet or a USB cable for computer recharging. Very convenient.The clarity is superb and I've never had a problem understanding any phone calls. The headset is lodged into the ear lobe with the help of a soft Silicone (at least I think its Silicone) wedge which I thought would be uncomfortable at best. It wasn't and turned out to be actually pleasant.I can find absolutely nothing wrong with the Plantronics Discovery. For approximately $120, I would hope not anyway, but I find its ease-of-use and setup to be so enjoyable that I heartily recommend it. I did wish the manual were a tad larger and easier to read, and the user has to be really careful as I can see how easy it would be to break the headset but that's a small quibble for a phenomenal product. I guess I have walked into the light, the blue light.**UPDATE** January 28, 2010Within 6 months, the microphone on the unit checked out and I now have an expensive paperweight. I'm downgrading this review from five stars to two stars.","06 17, 2008",ATJE929ETFFNH,"Fred ""Fred""",Sleek Design--Won't Last Long,1213660800,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

After logging hundreds of hours on this, I sadly had to buy a replacement since the battery would no longer hold a charge for more than 10 minutes of talk time.Anyway, here are my findings after having it as my companion for so long:PROS- It is very clear. In fact, it's night and day better than my integrated car bluetooth.- Looks great! The style is sleek and the tight package is perfect. I think it look just as nice as the 975.- Excellent build quality. Four years is a long time and it still looks new.- Does a great job of keeping unwanted noise, like wind, out.- Having volume control right on the unit (low, medium, high) is helpful.CONS- I don't like using a universal button that I have to depress to turn on and off. Sometimes my phone doesn't pick it up and I have to restart my phone (happened to iPhone 3G and iPhone 5).- If you buy the bulk packaging version instead of the retail, you may be missing some accessories like case/charger or additional gels. I would only buy the bulk version to replace a another 925, otherwise I would purchase retail.OVERALLI was very pleased with my purchase.

Even after the novelty wears off in other words. I simply can't live without out. And bought in case - I dropped mine in the snow just after a snow storm that left 2 feet on the ground as I was walking to rescue my car I had to abandoned the night before. Walking down a hill, I placed it in my pocket, not well enough obviously. So after a few hours of denial and looking for it, I came to Amazon and ordered my 2nd one. I am back to using a corded headset on my iPhone, and it just sucks. I have zero hesitation in recommending this headset to you. Yes, it's pricey, but you'll truly get something that you'll use all the time. It just works, it's crystal clear, and I simply can not live without it.There's just 2 things I'd like to note. An included lanyard would be helpful! I wanted a lanyard from the second I opened the box. And 2, if you don't keep your ears clean, it has a tendency to come loose, but has never fallen from my ear. Let me add 2 more things actually. It is so light, I often forget I am wearing and end up looking for it :) when it's right in my ear all along.

B001630QZE,"[139, 153]",5,"The search for the perfect Bluetooth headset is never-ending, it seems.  In the last 3 years, I've gone through more brands and models than I care to think about.  Now I've tried the Plantronics Discovery 925, and tell you with no hesitation that it is in the top two of those I have used.The Plantronics Discovery 925 is more an earpiece than a headset, with an earbud that fits inside the ear with surprising comfort, rather than an earloop that hangs over the ear.  This means that it is much more comfortable to wear with eyeglasses and/or sunglasses.  Indeed it is so comfortable that I sometimes forget I am wearing it.Pairing the device is a snap, and while my old Jabra headset frequently lost its pairing (weekly at least), the Plantronics Discovery 925 has not yet.The sound quality is tremendous.  Audio is crystal clear from both my side and on the caller's side, if my friends and family are to be believed.  LOLPlantronics touts this headset as having great noise reduction technology, and I will say that it is better in the noise reduction arena than all but one of the headsets I've tried in the past.  The only headset I have personally tried that surpasses the Plantronics Discovery 925 in noise reduction is the Jawbone headset.What I really love about the Discovery 925 is the charging options.  This headset comes with both an AC charger cable and a USB charger cable.  Not only that, it comes with a compact charging case.  You can charge the headset either in the case or directly, using the same cables for each.  The beauty of the case is that it charges alongside the headset when you have it plugged in to electrical power.  Then when your headset's battery dies, you simply put the headset in the case to recharge on the go - WITHOUT connecting either the case or the headset to electrical current.  I've purposely let the headset's charge completely drain and charged it with the case, and found it worked admirably.  And to top it all off, the Plantronics Discovery 925 charges fully in just a couple of hours, whether via electrical current or the portable charge case.Now here is where I prove what a woman I can be.  The last quality I want to point out is purely cosmetic - its appearance.  This is by far the most attractive headset I've ever seen.  It's design almost looks like a cufflink or tie clip.  It is sleek, innocuous, and comes in three different colors:  black, gold, and pink.  Personally, I like the more unobtrusive black model myself, but for those who want a little bit livelier hue, the other options work too.  Yeah, I know, the appearance is a pretty frivolous virtue, but as often as we wear these things nowadays, it is nice to find a Bluetooth headset that doesn't have to trade form for function.For the best in noise reduction, Jawbone's Bluetooth headset is the overall winner, but Plantronics Discovery 925 runs a very close second in this category.  In all other categories, I would choose Plantronics as the number one headset.Phone used with:HP iPaq 6945 Unlocked Cell Phone with Wi-fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, SD--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver)Most recent Headsets I've used:Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Headset - BlackAliph Jawbone Noise Shield Bluetooth Headset- BlackJabra BT250v Bluetooth Headset with Vibrating Alert [Retail Packaged]Logitech Mobile Freedom Bluetooth HeadsetMotorola H300 Bluetooth Headset","06 2, 2008",A23ZNGL704AW7O,Jennifer Ray,"Sleek, sexy little headset doesn't sacrifice form or function",1212364800,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

Nice for long weekend getaways as you don't have to worry about bringing a charger should you wish not to or forget it.

You know the ones I'm talking about, walking the city streets with their Star Trek earpieces, loudly conducting business calls as they hammer out messages on their Blackberry with one hand and cradle a triple grande mocha latte in the other. These Bluetooth headsets always seemed like the absolute height of self important gadgetry to me (though I vaguely recall thinking the same thing about cell phones a decade ago). So with my sense of self righteousness firmly in place, what do you think my reaction was when offered the opportunity to try out Plantronics' new Discovery 925 Bluetooth Headset? You guessed it - I agreed right away, eyes a-twinkle with the prospect of a shiny new technology toy.Whatever prejudices I had for these things, they disappeared pretty fast once I got my hands on the Discovery 925. First off, it's the first gadget in a while that didn't require a chainsaw to open the packaging. Second, this thing looks really cool. This is no clunky operator headset; it's a slick, streamlined vision from a sci-fi future. It even comes in a neat little leather charger/case. Third, it's pretty darned easy to set up. It's not so intuitive that you don't need the manual, but it doesn't take much to get up and running. It took all of a minute to find the right page and program my phone to sync with the headset. After that it was just a matter of fitting the piece and learning the buttons.The Discovery 925 proved useful almost immediately, as it arrived just prior to a family vacation. I'm not the best when it comes to driving and, well, anything else. I can talk on the phone and drive, but my concentration is not what it should be. I've used headsets in the past but the cord never seemed long enough, and kept getting snagged in the seatbelt. The Discovery 925 lets me keep my eyes on the road and hands on the wheel, which my fellow motorists (not to mention my passengers) no doubt appreciate. It also came in handy when I got home to find a malfunctioning cable box. With the headset in place I was able to talk to technical support while checking connections, pulling cords, looking for serial numbers, and throwing my hands up in frustration as each ""fix"" failed. The sound quality never faltered, even when I crawled behind (or inside) the entertainment center.It's not cheap, but the Discovery 925 is still a worthwhile purchase. I guess I'm a believer now. I'm still not going to wear it on the streets though! I mean it. Well, maybe if I have to carry a lot of stuff, or want to shift that latte from one hand to the other, but that's OK right? Right?

I also had my much smaller friend try it (with a different eartip) and it fit her equally as well.The ease of connection and sound quality is pure Plantronics.

B001630QZE,"[1, 1]",4,"I just purchased this headset and so far I think this was a good choice. It's light and stylish, especially with the Gold color - more feminine than black and silver (like most Bluetooth earpieces). Also, with the ""V"" shape, it's not that noticeable - pretty discrete. I love the charging/storage case that comes with this headset. It offers a great way to carry my headset in my purse and a real convenient way to charge the headset during the day. The headset comes with a USB charger and an AC charger (which you plug into the case or directly into the headset).So far in testing it, the sound is very clear on both sides (for me and for the caller on the other end). I had the Plantronics 665 and people often told me that I sounded staticky. I don't get that from this earpiece.The only thing that I have to get used to is the silicone (or rubber) earpiece. The headset comes with three (large, medium and small). The large and medium earpieces look a little different than the small - it has an extra little nub that kind of helps the headset stay put in your ear. The small earpiece doesn't have this nub. I called Plantronics to actually see if they had earpieces similar to the ones used for the 665, and that's how I found out about the extra little nub. I've been using the medium earpiece and so far haven't had a problem with it.Since I just got this, I'll have to use it more to really see if this fits my needs. But so far, I'm glad I purchased this.Updated ReviewSo I used this earpiece for about a week and found that the fit just was not right. Despite coming with 3 different earbuds, I could not find one that fit (the small was too small, the medium sort of fit, but felt like the earpiece was going to fall out). I recently ordered the Jawbone Prime and I just love that earpiece. Calls are much clearer and noise cancellation is much better. Earpieces are very unique to the individual using them. I'd recommend trying this Plantronics 925 for yourself - it may work for you. Just didn't work for me.","05 28, 2009",A21XV1593GYBXT,L.

B001630QZE,"[1, 1]",4,"This is a high end bluetooth headset for your mobile phone that comes with some interesting accessories.The sound quality is excellent. It has noise reduction to help block background noise.  The only caveat to this is that it only appears to work when you're talking... when you're not, the person on the other end can hear the noise (such as your car radio). But when you speak it blocks out most of the other sounds.Its functions are controlled by a multifunction control button and a volume button. This is pretty standard and functions by holding the button down for different lengths of time and listening for beeps. Moving from my Motorola headset to this one was no problem, they worked the same.This headset is very lightweight and has a soft eartip that holds it in your ear by pressure (like iPod earbuds).  It does not have the hook that goes over your ear, so someone who has hearing aides can not use it.As I said, it comes with some nice accessories. You get 3 different size eartips, the AC wall charger, a USB charging cable, and (the most unique of all) the charging case.  This case has it's own built in battery.  When the headset needs charging, you can place it in the case and it will recharge the headset completely one time. This is nice if you're traveling and can't plug in the charger. The USB cable allows you to charge either the headset or the case and the headset from a powered USB port on your computer. If you're traveling with a laptop, you don't need to drag along the AC adapter to charge the headset. Charging time using the USB cable is longer than using the AC adapter. Full charge with the AC adapter takes 3 hours, the USB cable takes 9 hours.  To charge the case, you must put the headset in it and charge both at the same time. It still only takes 3 hours.  Run time on the battery is good...talk time is up to 5 hours and standby is up to 175 hours.

B001630QZE,"[0, 0]",4,"Let me preface my review by stating that the only time I use my headset is when I'm driving.  I'm not one of those people who needs to wear it all the time, just when I'm running errands but still need to be available for calls.  My car has the built-in wireless for my phone but my husband's does not and I find myself in a bind whenever I have to use his car.  So I figured I would give this one a try.  I've used it for about 3 weeks now and I love it!  I am not a high volume user (but I do find myself using more and more due to its convenience and quality) so I cannot attest to it's long term durability but so far so good.  I've tried a few others and just didn't like the bulky feel.  This one is comfortable and effortless to use.  When I first saw this headset, I was not too sure how durable it would be since you just place it in your ear with nothing else to hold it in place.  Now, I wonder how I ever lived without it.  Plenty of others have provided the technical side so I'm writing from a customer satisfaction view.  It stays in place just fine, has clear audio, good volume control, no quality issues, easy to use and feels natural.Now on to the only minor issues I have with this product.  I am in the process of getting over the ""ick"" factor of sticking it in my ear and wiping it clean after every use.  Also, this product is very expensive, especially when compared to other headsets.  Granted, I did not like the others I tried and maybe you get what you pay for but do we really need to pay this much?  Combining the cleanliness factor (which might not bother anyone else) and the high price, I deducted a point.","06 19, 2008",A18S2VGUH9SCV5,Margaux Paschke,a bit pricey but a great option,1213833600,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

This unit is clearly meant to compete against the high-end Bluetooth headsets like theAliph JawboneandAliph Jawbone 2.  A quick glance at the prevailing and list prices for the various models makes that clear.  While this device is definitely competitive in terms of quality with those other earpieces, it still comes at a steep price given some of its cons. This is a good product, and still worthy of being considered among the best.  But I will definitely be looking for the redesigned successor to include some improvements.PROS:+ The in-ear fit is definitely more convenient, if slightly less secure, than over-the-ear models+ The earpieces are extremely comfortable and easy to clean+ Three included earpiece sizes will fit most people+ Can be set up for use with two devices+ Battery life is very good, and made better by the included charging case+ Nice compact size feels very light in the ear+ Easy to set  up and pair with your devices+ Sound clarity works pretty well for such a headset, though wind is still not fully cancelled out+ Has attractive looks, though some will prefer the Jawbone's looksCONS:- Priced very high considering the materials- The noise cancellation is acceptable but could be better- Warning beeps are annoying and can't be disabled- Volume only has three levels- The range is on the shorter side- Travel case inexplicably includes no clip for wearing on your belt- The two included buttons require multiple clicks for use, and aren't very functional- Uses a different USB B interface than the standard- The 3 included earpieces will fit most people, but not everybodyCOMPARING TO THE COMPETITIONWhen it really comes down to it, this unit performs well at the most important things.  It sounds pretty good and fits comfortably in the ear.  I mainly wish the noise cancellation was just a tad better.  I don't understand why they didn't use the standard USB B connector.  I'm also perplexed as to why they only included 3 volume levels in such a high cost product.While looks are subjective, I prefer the look of both Jawbones.  Some may actually prefer the looks of the 925.  The Jawbones just feel more like premium headphones than this one does.  To be fair, the Aliph Jawbone also has drawbacks.  The over-the ear design of the Jawbone makes it less ideal for those with glasses.  The original one also has some small parts that can be prone to breaking.  In that sense, the 925 does have some traits that are better.When people can get a budget headset for a quarter of the price, it's a hard sell to convince them this is better.  When on sale this may be no-brainer purchase.  For those willing to pay a premium it's still worth consideration versus the other high end units out there.  But be mindful of the cons and make sure you can live with this unit's shortcomings.Enjoy.","01 15, 2009",A17BUUBOU0598B,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","Plantronics Discover 925 - High Price, Decent Quality, Some Drawbacks",1231977600,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

The first thing you need to do is use your phone to record through `voice dialing'. Once you have all your names correctly vocalized in your phone, you choose `Bluetooth' in your phone `settings' to synchronize and you are off!I really didn't pay much attention to the style of the Discovery 925, but it is smaller than most and isn't obnoxious looking. I had some trouble with the plastic ear-tips as this device is so light, I can't tell if it is in my ear or not. I finally had to shake my head several times to feel confident that it would not fall out. The ease of use is remarkable. Just a few taps for every function is really simple. The sound clarity is also very good and even when outside with a slight breeze, my callers said the reception was clear.I also like the small rechargable box that comes with the Discovery 925. I can leave that at work or in my car and know that if the battery charge runs down, I will be able to charge the earpiece right back up. Maybe I am easily amazed, but this voice controlled earpiece is a lot of fun and with the ""hands-free"" driving law in effect on July 1st, 2008 in California, this will be nice to have.I would warn any buyers to fully charge both the earpiece through a wall socket overnight as well as the charger box through your computer USB port. It is advised to charge at least 3 hours, but why take a chance?UPDATE!I accidentally placed 5 stars here.

B001630QZE,"[23, 23]",4,"I have not had great experiences so far with bluetooth headsets and my Tilt phone. It pairs great with the handfree in my car, but the sound quality and noise is so bad, it's pretty much unusable. I had also tried using it with a  handsfree stereo headset from Sony and had major pairing issues with that. So was a little unsure about trying this but really wanted something better particularly to use in the car.Pairing with this was a breeze. My phone had no problem detecting it and I've yet to have a problem with them finding each other when I turn BT on and off on the phone. The sound quality of this headset really blew me away. Callers on the other end said they really would not have guessed I was using a headset at all, it doesn't have near the ""tunnel"" sound that many headsets do. In the car as well, background noise was quite adequately filtered out.Feature wise it has a few nice touches. Double click the call button to repeat a call, hold it for a couple seconds to place a call with voice dial (if your phone supports it), or hold it during a call to transfer the call to the phone. It also supports pairing with two phones which could be handy for some people. There's no mute button and the volume button is a little hard to find though. I had no problem using it with the voice dialing on my phone so far which is certainly much appreciated with phones like the Tilt that are not particularly easy to dial from. The charging case is a great feature as well, it's compact and reasonably light for something that has an internal battery. The case is well padded and closes magnetically, providing excellent protection for the headset. Removing the phone from the case is a tad tricky at first, but easier with practice.I really only have one complaint with it and that is the fit. I will admit, I have very small ears and any in-ear device is prone to give me problems, particularly if it is not entirely soft plastic (as many good music headsets these days are). And indeed even the smallest eartip on this is still very tight and somewhat uncomfortable in my ear. I've certainly had worse, and it's not so bad as to be a deal-breaker for me. But I also don't do more than a few calls on my cell a week, so am not using it extensively. If I did, this would be a bigger issue for me. As it is, I just have a sore ear for a little while after using it. I still prefer the small size and very stable design versus ones that go over the ear (which are problematic for me as well since I wear glasses).One final kudo for Plantronics...as an environmentally conscious consumer, I was happy to see that the plastic sleeve this came in uses recyclable plastic. I'm always happy to support companies that are doing their part (and don't give me annoyingly difficult packaging to open as well!)","05 21, 2008",ARXU3FESTWMJJ,"Mary Jo Sminkey ""15 years of Amazon Reviews!""","Great sound quality, difficult fit for small ears",1211328000,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)
B001630QZE,"[0, 0]",5,"Let me begin this review with a short list of the ""higher end"" earpieces I've owned - Motorola HS490, HS750, Micro (I do enjoy this one) - the 490 was the first earpiece I owned, these ran around $125 retail at the time, aside from the Micro which was $250...also the original Jawbone and the second version - the $199 retail models.  I also tried a Samsung and a Sony in the same price range, and finally ended up happy when I picked up a Plantronics 975 for $129 on sale when it was priced at $225.The 975 and 925 both come with a smallish leather case that has a li-ion battery pack in it, which allows 3-5 charges of the earpiece, depending how close to empty the pieces battery level is.  If the earpiece actually warns you vocally about low battery you've got perhaps fifteen minutes of talk time left...that's where you'll see the 3 charges.  The earpiece can be placed into the case while you're recharging the case battery and it'll charge the earpiece first, then complete the recharge on the case.  In my experience,  placing the earpiece in the case while I'm out and about will take the LCD battery meter on the case which shows the charge on the piece goes from 1 bar to full in around 60-90 minutes.I personally wear both of mine on a plantronics accessory lanyard around my neck with the power on whenever I leave the house and find that if I spend perhaps 30 minutes on Bluetooth talk and 3 hours on standby it easily goes 3 or 4 days before needing a charge.  The 925 & 975 are essentially identical in this regard, I purchased the 925 due to loving my 975 and wanting a backup earpiece for days I'm on the phone nonstop and kill the battery.  It lasts for 4-5 hours of talk time, which I found more than adequate until accepting a consulting position that has me on the phone for up to 8-10 hours a day.  The reason I bought a 925 is so I can easily tell my headsets apart at a glance. I'll run one to empty, link the other, which is amazingly simple - both show as ""Plantronics 9xx"" on my iPhone 4 and once I paired them both, they link up instantly when I turn either of them on, then I pop the dead one into one of the case / chargers and move on with my day.Both the headsets function identically, they just have a different look to them, but I'll close with a summary of the reasons why you should buy either a 925 or 975.If you want to be able to talk in a convertible or with your windows down, the person you're talking with will never even notice.  The noise canceling mics (2 in each) are positively amazing.  The volume goes up to a quite loud level, I keep mine at 50% volume and only turn it up if I take a call while at a Capitals or Ravens game - Verizon Center gets ridiculously loud but I still have no problem having a conversation on the earpiece...that says a hell of a lot about the quality of the microphone tandem and the speaker, which includes a variety of sizes of clear rubber inserts that hold the piece in your ear and blocks background noise surprisingly well.  Both of the headsets work flawlessly with iPhone voice commands and alerts.In closing, I couldn't be happier with the Plantronics earpieces, and I couldn't recommend them more highly.  If you're deciding between the 925 and 975, they function identically - just choose the one that you prefer the look of.","11 14, 2011",A1JQB7Y2Q7UJLM,M.

B001630QZE,"[4, 4]",4,"I am a headset junkie, and have tried most and owned many. To date, the Discovery 925 is my all-time favorite, retiring my 1st generation Jawbone, which I reverted to after trying two different examples of the 2nd generation Jawbone. Both examples were inferior in every way to the original Jawbone.I bought the D925 primarily because the hybrid soft silicon/metal ear hook on the original Jawbone was falling apart, with the rubber separating from the metal. Also, the in-ear fit of the Jawbone was abysmal, which I complained about to the manufacturer and was told that other customers had reported solving this problem by using Jabra ear gels from old wired headsets. I had some around, tried them, and they worked, improving the fit and comfort of the Jawbone. When the NEW Jawbone was introduced, I bought one, quickly returning it for what I thought was a defective speaker, which was tinny and raspy. The replacement unit was the same, and I returned that as well. The audio quality of the original Jawbone was WAY better than the new, improved model.Anyway, I have used the D925 for about a month now, and can report that it is, on balance, the best fitting and sounding Bluetooth headset I have tried.Ergonomics: The default (medium) ear gel is the perfect fit for me, and the device is completely secure in either ear while remaining comfortable from dark to dark. I was skeptical that it would remain secure without an earhook, but it has never fallen out of either ear yet. And here's a great advantage to the design of this device; you can quickly switch it from one ear to the other without changing earhooks! The eargel snugs down into either ear with a quick quarter twist, and removes just as easily. I don't use it, but the device comes with a neck lanyard that can be used to hang the device around the neck. The lanyard attaches into the micro-USB charging port. Another thing I really like about this device is that you don't have to go around with your ear blinking like a refugee from a Borg ship. What good is that feature, really? Can you look at your ear while wearing the headset to see if you're connected? All the connection indicator does is distract and irritate others in meetings, or conversational groups. Good riddance! I have never used the small volume button on the edge of the unit, preferring to make volume adjustments from my Blackberry. The large call/answer button comprises the entire vertical surface of the device, and depresses easily and with slight tactile feedback. What a welcome change from the awful call/answer button on the Jawbone!Audio - Speaker: Incoming audio is excellent, as good as the Jawbone, which is also excellent. No complaints whatsoever.Audio - Microphone: Outgoing sound quality is excellent, and sensitivity is excellent. (*See Why FOUR stars below.)Noice Cancelling: Inferior to the Jawbone, but still better than any of the other headsets I have used. Called parties report some BG noise in busy restaurants or crowded events, but no road noise at freeway speeds. Advantage - Jawbone.Radio Quality: Excellent. Beats the Jawbone in terms of range and quiet signal within close proximity.Features: A neat little black case contains a battery that will recharge the D925 once without AC. The leather (MAYBE it's leather...doesn't matter) case has its own micro USB charger input, and the D925 settles into it and connects through the same micro USB connector used to charge from the AC charger (supplied.) A standard USB to micro USB cable is also provided for charging from an available PC USB port. Large, medium, and small eargels are provided. As with all late-design Plantronics headsets, pairing is a no-brainer, with the device powering up in pairing mode on first use.Why FOUR stars, then? Because the noise cancellation could be better, and because the D925 (like the Jawbone) is VERY susceptible to voice blanking in the slightest air current. Out in a slight breeze? Forget it. Find a sheltered area. I have to redirect or turn off the air conditioning in my car when making a call. If any air from the vents hits the device, it voice blanks and your other-end caller hears Niagara Falls. I don't mean to over-emphasize this, it isn't a big problem for me, just a minor irritation.I can heartily recommend this device. It's the best I've had or used.","09 12, 2008",A22RS9XNLGIRSF,Michael St James,Best yet; many great features.,1221177600,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

Plantronics really hit a home run in the visual design department. This is the first bluetooth headset that I've ever worn that didn't make me feel like I was one of Star Trek's ""Borg"" cyborgs. The particular unit that I purchased was gold in color. Unlike the unfortunately lit stock photos, the gold color of the unit looks classy as opposed to gaudy. It's a true metallic tone the will match most dress clothing very well (so as not to look out of place at work, for example). The charging case doesn't fare as well looks-wise. It's essentially a faux-leather charging case with a gold spray paint coating. But that's ok, you aren't buying this for the looks of the case.FUNCTIONALITYThe whole retail setup consists of one Discovery 925 headset, a matching charging case, a wall charger, and three gel earbuds to fit various ear sizes. The wall charger, charging case, and earbuds all perform their duties admirably. The wall charger is small and unobtrusive, charging my particular unit to a full charge in a little over 2 hours. The charging case takes a little longer to charge, but the trade off of charging time is well worth the portability and protection offered by the case. The easily removable earbuds come in a variety of sizes to fit even small ears snugly, securing the unit in your ear even when you jog.The headset itself is relatively easy to use. There only two buttons (pretty much standard on any bluetooth headset these days), one very large multi-purpose button used for powering the device on and off as well as activating your phone's features (in my case, voice dial, redial, etc.), and one button for volume. One unfortunate gripe I have with the 925 is that it only has one volume button (as opposed to two ""rocker"" style buttons for up and down) and three volume settings. There is no fine tuning the volume on this unit and it suffers in the form of calls that are too quiet on the road, or too loud at home.The battery life was rather good for this headset. In 27 days of continuous use (about a half hour each day), I've only had to charge the unit + charging case twice. That is fantastic considering that I carried it with me everywhere I went.PERFORMANCESadly call performance, the only thing that really matters in a bluetooth headset, was lacking. The initial quality on calls is decent in a quiet room. In fact, even in my car on city streets it was ok. However, any kind of direct noise from wind just crippled with unit. Further to the point, when the SoundIQ processor engages to remove background noise (like freeway road noise, or especially wind), the volume on the other end of the call (e.g. the person I'm talking to) fluctuates terribly. Almost everyone I talked to said that my voice faded in and out like I was getting further and closer to the microphone over and over again. As soon as I got into a relatively quiet environment, this effect stopped. This is a deal-breaker. Too many people complained of being unable to hear me properly due to this close-far effect.VERDICTI really wanted to like this headset. I got a fantastic price (more than 75% off retail) from Amazon and the convenience of the charging/carrying case was just too good to pass up. However, in the end I just can't get around the poor call quality for the people I call.Pros- Modern/svelte design, convenient charging/carrying case, great battery lifeCons- Consistently terrible call quality on the receiving end of phone calls, no ear loop option for people with sensitive inner ears3/5 stars","05 19, 2010",A3KEUUNAO0ATOZ,"Nicholas Ehlers ""Nick""",Stylish Headset with Mediocre Performance,1274227200,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

B001630QZE,"[2, 2]",3,"I bought this headset a little over a month ago for use strictly while I'm driving. I don't know about you, but I'm always annoyed by people who stroll around Wal-Mart talking on their headset and I don't want to be THAT person! If I had to do it all over again I would buy a different headset, but this one isn't so bad that I would take it back or buy a new one.Anyway, here is my list of the good and the bad:THE GOOD:1. Sound quality is awesome. I can hear everyone else loud and clear and when I ask them they say they can hear me just fine (that's the most important feature!).2. Pairing is easy - but isn't it easy for virtually every headset?3. It is incredibly light and kinda stylish looking.4. The charging case is awesome. It makes it easy to carry around without worrying about damaging it.5. I've had mine for a month and I've only had to bring it inside to charge it once (I leave it in the charging case in the console of my car 90% of the time).6. The large multi-function button is easy to find and press. I didn't think it was a big deal until I tried to use my wife's headet that has a much smaller button.THE BAD:1. It is uncomfortable. I have pretty small ears and even with the small ear gel it is uncomfortable. If it sits in my ear for longer than 10-15 minutes I have to swap it to the other ear because it starts to hurt. I've browsed the internet for 3rd party ear gels that might be more comfortable, but have yet to find one. I've tried all different types of positions and the most comfortable one is still not comfortable.2. It really needs an ear hook to hold it in place. It often starts to droop down towards the bottom of my jawline, and that's while I'm sitting still driving in my car. The one time I walked around with it in my ear I had to reposition it at least once a minute.3. The push button volume thing is kinda stupid. Even the cheaper headsets have a more advanced volume control.4. Plantronics customer service is quite possibly the worst I've ever encountered. When I got the headset I tried all the features and found the voice dial wasn't working. After browsing the internet and trying everything I could think of, I called Plantronics tech support. He had a tone of, ""Why the heck are you bothering me"" the entire time. After I explained everything to him he said the device was faulty and I needed to return it. I paid shipping to return it and when I got my replacement headset the voice dial still wasn't working. I eventually found out that my phone - iPhone - doesn't support bluetooth voice dialing. Shouldn't the tech guy think to ask me that? Due to his idiocy I had to spend money returning the device.My wife has a Jabra 4010 headset that costs less than half the price of the Plantronics Discovery 925, and I wish I had gotten that one instead. It's MUCH more comfortable, and the few times I've used it the sound quality on both ends was just as good as the Plantronics.","05 6, 2009",ADGIGEKDJNY4A,P.

I have it paired with my Motorolla Razor, and setup was a breeze.I have, however, had a few lapses in call quality.

So if you can avoid those situations as much as possible, you should be just fine. Other than that, I haven't had any other issues with call quality or range. So far, it seems to hold a charge just fine, as I've had it in regular use for over a month and only had to charge it three times in that timespan.I'm still kind of disappointed I cannot use custom ringtones with this headset, but it's a minor issue.

At the time I claimed that it was the best Bluetooth headset on the market.  That was two years ago.  I have to update my statement as this is the first headset I have used that surpasses the 510 (still a very good headset, especially for the price).  This is without a doubt the best headset I have ever used.Pros:1. Light.  This unit is lighter then many similar devices.  Even though it comes out on the face farther then some the material is very nice.2. Appealing.  One of the negatives of the Plantronics line has always been that they were ugly.  This device changes that.  The unit is slick with a nice chrome/black finish across that seems to resist scratching.3. Great battery life.4. Backup batter life by having the battery case included.5. Included case provides protection along with the charging.6. Comes with both USB power cable and AC adapter for the case.7. Multipoint technology (connect with two devices at once) is a must for me and works flawlessly.8. Outside noise reduction works incredibly well.9. Power on and power off button easy access on facing panel of device.10. Distinctive noise tones make for easy control.11. Comes with 3 different size ear pieces.Cons:1. ***Updated*** A commenter noted I incorrectly stated that you had to charge the device in the case not from the cables.  I was incorrect.  This makes this point/feature a pro not a con.  ***Updated***2. Breaks from the standard Plantronics plugs adapters so you won't be able to use any legacy power cables you may have.3. Ear pieces are still not overly comfortable.  At least not for me although they stay in the ear very well.This is very good headset and one that I plan on using for the next year or two.  This is definitely my pick in this market and there is very little I would change on it.

Yes, it looks sleek and neat - and I was very happy with my prior Plantronics Voyager 510 headset, BUT -It is one of the most uncomfortable earpieces I've ever had. I was just on a call of 28 minutes and my ear hurts. I cannot put the unit back on my ear now because of the pain it causes. I've tried adjusting the gel, tried different gels, but can't find any combination that doesn't hurt my ear after being on for a moderate period of time.The instructions that come with the unit are sparse and inadequate.And the unit itself is ""fragile"" - mine will already need to be exchanged/warranty returned: now, when I put any pressure on it (pushing it in my ear, or pushing the control button, or even touching it) it starts making a horrible static-y, tone-y loud background noise. Sometimes the noise stops when the finger is moved away - other times it stays and I have to switch to using the handset because it's impossible to hear the caller with the added interference.There are a couple of good points for this product, though:1) The sound going into the mic is fed back to the earpiece - So, for example, if it's windy you'll know whether you're sending wind noise to the caller. When I'm riding my bike, I find that I can turn my head slightly and eliminate/substantially reduce wind noise. With a headset that doesn't feedback your audio, you have no idea of the noise you are sending.2) The leather carrycase/charger is nice esp since I wouldn't wear any bluetooth all the time. It protects the unit and makes it easy to put in a pocket. HOWEVER - it is NOT easy to seat into the charging plug, and I think that the case being a charger may reduce the life of the internal battery of the earpiece when it is frequently moved in and out of the case (and consequently frequently partially charged/discharged).The discomfort and poor performance/durability makes me regret the purchase.","12 20, 2008",A1M6GJJAGVE4Y5,RG,Uncomfortable & fragile,1229731200,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

Maybe it's just my particular skin oils, but after about two weeks, the gels absorb oil from my skin and get rather slippery. As a result, the gels start to spin around on the headset and don't stay in my ear as well.

The styling also cannot be denied with a sleek and sophisticated look that incorporates a boom mike to further enhance its audio quality.  When in use, the blue and red light arrays adds a further layer of polish giving an initial impression of something straight from the future in comparison to the ubiquitous staid and chunky headsets so much more common these days.  So yes, as far as my initial litmus test goes - this headset delivers everything I want in terms of looking good and something not to be ashamed of when strutting out and about in public.As far as audio quality goes I am very pleased.  The Discovery 925 series incorporates Plantronics' latest signal enhancement technology - AudioiQ - which will automatically adjust levels based on the noise in your surrounding environment, on both ends to enhance how you sound and what you hear.  After using this headset for about a dozen hours of talk time I am very satisfied with the consistency of the sound of my calls through the headpiece.Another minor delight of mine was the ease in which I was able to pair this device to my iPhone.  Highly recommend this product to anyone in the market looking for a bluetooth headset.","06 19, 2008",A3M6TSEV71537G,Sibelius,Oh so sleek and chic,1213833600,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)
B001630QZE,"[0, 0]",4,"I have used discovery 925 for over a month now.  I have used it both with my computer (Sony Vaio) and Motorola Razr.  It connected right away with my phone.  However, when it came to my computer, I had to make a couple of attempts.  I still have not figured it out how to connect to both of them simultaneously.Pluses:1.Sound quality is outstanding.  People do not even know I am using a headset.  I used to own a Plantronics 320.  It worked OK; but this one is far superior.  Wind noise blocking is better than 320 but not the best.  You have to turn your face away from the wind and it does the trick.2. Extremely light weight.  The ear plug design is highly innovative and comfortable.3. Comes with three ways of charging it: portable charger, USB charger and a normal charger.Minuses:1. A few times, I have faced some technical issues.  For example, despite the 925 being connected with the Razr, I cannot hear the caller neither does the caller hear me.  So its essentially dead.  I tried switching audio to my phone and that did not work either.  I never had this problem with my 320.2.  Still not able to connect to two devices simultaneously (computer and a phone). I am well versed with a variety of technological products.  So I don't think its my mistake.3.  Talk time is not as good as the 320.  So I have to charge it everyday.  Admittedly, I talk a lot.All in all a very good product, but more work is needed on the glitches.","09 13, 2008",A2JTCH13WD0O3Y,SP,Good product with some small issues,1221264000,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)
B001630QZE,"[1, 1]",5,"At the deep discount for which Amazon sell this earpiece, I bought two (one for me and one for my wife). The sound is clear (I left a test message on my home answering machine), the unit is lightweight, unobtrusive, paired flawlessly with our Samsung phones, and is easy to insert and remove.While I love technology, my wife just wants something to be simple and work without any hassles. This earpiece does it. To turn it on, press and a blue light comes on to confirm it is on; to turn it off, press again and a red light comes on to confirm it is off. It takes a second to take it on and off, and if you wear glasses there is nothing annoying hanging over your ear to interfere. It works great when my wife's cell phone is buried deep within her pocketbook.I have a number of bluetooth headsets gathering dust because they were a pain to use. While some reviewers have said they would like this unit to have more features, for me and my wife it is fine as it because it does one thing very well and better than any other earpiece we have used--lets us use our cell phones hands free with a sound quality that is virtually the same as speaking directly into our cell phones. I highly recommend it.","01 15, 2009",A3NEAETOSXDBOM,Stephen M.

The Motorola H700 was the first and I really liked it.Pros:* Good sounding audio. Very clear and sharp.* People hear me very well and don't know I'm on a headset until I tell them.* Noise cancellation works well. Did the dog barking test and it passed.* It's comfortable to wear.* Very lightweight.* Carrying case that doubles as a charger is excellent.* Not bad looking.* Easy to pair and Plantronics has a great tutorial online if you need help. [...]* Makes it easy to wear glasses since it doesn't have the earloop.Cons:* For those who wear it while driving like I do and have a nice stereo in their car it dampens the audio from the ear you're wearing it in. The Motorola H700 did not do that because it fit on the ear and not in it. Of course this only applies to when you're not actually on a call.* Buttons are small.* Charging connector is small and directional and therefore difficult to insert at times.Overall I think it's a great headset and Amazon has buy far, the best prices.

B001630QZE,"[180, 196]",2,"Let me start by saying I LOVE Plantronics products.  Years ago when I used to sell electronics I would always push their products (I did not receive a commission) because they were far superior in sound quality than any other brand out there.  I am the type of person who will spend extra money on something that works well as opposed to something cheap that is not up to the same level of quality.  Here is my review of each aspect of the product:Size/Weight: First, this product is very very light weight. When I first took the headset out of the package and held it I thought it was ""cheap"" feeling because it was so light but after thinking about it for a moment I realized I would much rather have it feel light and cheap than heavy and weighing down my ear.  Overall I am extremely happy with this aspect of the headset.Comfort:  The weight of the product and the gel-ish inserts made the product fit comfortably in my ear.  I wore the product for lengthy periods and never felt any significant level of discomfort.  Overall I am impressed by the aspect of this headset.Style: First, I do not rock a fanny pack for a reason and in my opinion most Bluetooth headsets remind me of fanny packs and black socks with sandals.  They are a fashion ""oh heck no."" However, this particular headset is a nice inconspicuous size.  The gap between the two bars that make up the mouthpiece make the headset look better and less bulky.  Additionally, the mouthpiece is fairly short and does not overtake your face as you talk.  Overall, I am extremely happy with this aspect of the headset as I do not want to look like something out of a SciFi movie when chatting on the phone.Syncing with my Bluetooth device:  I have never synced any Bluetooth device to my current cell phone.  The process took under 30 seconds before they were paired together.  The instructions were crystal clear and I did not need my phone's manual to figure anything out.  This aspect of the headset worked amazing.And here's where it all went wrong...Sound Quality (Outgoing):  Let me start by saying, yes, I did have the mouthpiece directed in the way indicated by the Plantronics manual.  Also, my phone was sitting right next to me so this was not a matter of being too far away from my cell phone.  I spoke to dozens of people on the headset over the course of five days, all of whom asked, ""What was that?  Could you repeat that?  Huh?  etc.""  Most of the time I would have to disconnect the headset and go ""old-fashioned"" by actually using my hands.  When I needed to put the air conditioning on, it was impossible for the other party to hear me due to the wind noise so I had to shut my vents so I could be (somewhat)heard.  Even when there was no background noise of any sort (music, airconditioning, passenger noise), the product failed in this area.  Every person I spoke to complained.  Overall, I would rate this aspect of the headset almost unusable.Sound Quality (Incoming): Everyone I spoke to sounded distant, unclear, and not loud enough to hear well (yes, ALL volumes were at the maximum level).  Often I would try to shove the headset deeper in my ear hoping it would help, however, this would cause me to accidentally hit the ""call end"" button and hang up on the person I was speaking to.  After two times of doing that I learned my lesson and just strained to hear the best I could.  Overall, I would rate this aspect of the headset almost unusable.One star is the minimum Amazon lets a user rate a product.  I gave the rating one extra star because, had the outgoing/incoming quality been excellent, there would be no better Bluetooth product on the market right now because of size, weight, comfort, style, and ease of syncing.","05 23, 2008",A1QTHVA826XEOS,Super Mum,Very Poor Sound Quality,1211500800,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)
B001630QZE,"[7, 7]",4,"Through Amazon's Vine program, I recently received a review unit of the Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Headset.  Never having used (or had to use) a hands-free headset, I was interested to see how easy it would be to interface to my iPhone.  Overall, I'm impressed with the unit for ease of use as well as ease of interface.  But I'm still not completely comfortable with the unit just sitting in my ear.  I keep expecting it to fall out at any time.After a couple hours of charging via the USB power cord, I turned it on with a quick push of the earpiece.  Then with my iPhone, I switched into Bluetooth discovery mode and instantly found the Plantronics device.  I entered the password of 0000 to complete the pairing, and I was off and running.  The iPhone automatically threw control over to the headset for incoming calls, and tapping the headpiece control button brought up the keypad for dialing.  As a test of the sound quality, I dial the Jott message service and left myself a short message with a bit of background noise.  Jott was able to properly use its speech recognition to decipher the message and send it to me via email.  In terms of hearing, it was actually better than having the iPhone plastered against the side of my head.  If I were going to be on a call for any length of time using my iPhone, I'd definitely want to be using the Plantronics headset.The only drawback is the way it fits in the ear.  I'm used to seeing headsets that clip over the ear, so I was curious as to how snug this would feel with it just sitting there without external support.  I had to switch from the medium size clear plastic gel tip to the large size, as medium definitely felt like it was falling out.  Even with the large, it was hard to trust that it would stay there.  If you had too much head motion, I'm not sure how the grip would hold.  This is probably one of those things that just takes some getting used to.  I'll have to see how it works out over time.Would this replace my iPhone earbuds at $150?  Probably not.  I'm not that tethered to my cell phone.  But if you spend time in the car where it's illegal (or should be) to be holding a cell phone while driving, this would be an ideal way to stay reachable without worrying about wires getting in your way...","07 6, 2008",A3R19YKNL641X3,"Thomas Duff ""Duffbert""","Easy to use, but takes getting used to in terms of wearing it...",1215302400,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)
B001630QZE,"[1, 2]",4,"I've used a few bluetooth headsets in the past and was interested in trying out a Plantronics as a friend has been using one for a while and wouldn't stop raving about it.  Finally, I got the opportunity to try one out and I have to admit it's one of the nicest and clearest sets I've used.To start off, I just want to mention that the packaging is easy to open and, the unit, easy to get to.  At times with electronics it seems like you have to go through an obstacle course just to get at what you've paid a good amount of money for.  Not the case here.  The set itself is very small, surprisingly so.  The unit comes with 3 different sized eartips, I left in the medium sized one which works well enough for me, a carrying case which can be used as a charging unit, a regular AC charger, and a USB charging cable which I'm using at the moment.  I let the headset charge for 2 or so hours before using it for the first time and it worked well enough.So, the good:Small size.Feels comfortable enough in my ear.Great looking.You can easily hear the person whom you're speaking to and vice versa.The bad:The volume button could have been a bit bigger, it's small size while nice when measured against the unit as a whole leave something to be desired as it takes a while to adjust the volume with such a small button.The 'on/off' button feels 'flimsy' so when you push it you're not sure if you've actually initiated either the 'on' or 'off' function, depending on what you're trying to do.For the above reasons I thought 4 stars would be a good rating for this piece, also should mention that it is pricey compared to others on the market.  But it's small size and clarity I think make up for the 'bad'.","05 19, 2008",A2UKE7GIVC7XFW,T.

I had a Jawbone before and totally hated how I had to fumble with getting it around my ear all the time.The sound quality of the Plantronics Discovery 925 is quite good as is the noise cancellation and battery life is tops, way better than my Jawbone.It even comes with a seperate battery (built in to the case) so you can charge it while on the go for even more talk time-a very nice touch.After trying several different Bluetooth headsets over the years, this is the one that I'm keeping.

B001630QZE,"[9, 9]",5,"I have been reluctant to use a bluetooth.  I do not like the feel of most headsets in my ear, I am always worried about picking ambient noise, and I don't like walking down the street looking like I am talking to myself.  Well, the Discovery 925 answers two of the problems (I still look crazy walking down the street).First off, synching up the Discovery to my Motorola Razr was simple.  I just set my phone to look for the bluetooth, held down the two buttons on the Discovery and in a matter of seconds they were synched.Next, I placed it in my ear and was surprised how comfortable it felt.  I did have to switch the gel pad for a smaller one. It is nice that the headset comes with three (in different sizes) to choose from.As far as the sound quality I was impressed with how low I was able to speak and still have the person on the other end hear me.  Even out in public I did not have to shout over the noise in order to be heard.  When I needed to increase the volume, it was easy to locate the button because of the diamond shape of the ear piece.Last, but not least, is charging.  Plantronics could not have made this any better.  They give you three ways to charge your headset (depending on your environment.  First, you are given a standard AC power cord that plugs directly into the unit.  Next you are given a USB cord allowing you to charge your earpiece from any USB device (PC, laptop, etc.).  Finally, they give to a recharging battery case.  This nice looking case not only can store your headset while not in use, but it will recharge your headset via a battery that holds one full charge.  This is very convenient if you need yo charge your headset and don't want to bring either cord with you (The case can be recharged by using either cord.All in all I think Plantronics did a great job developing a headset that is comfortable, works well, and is very functional.  Is it more expensive than others? Yes, but it seems well worth the price.","05 21, 2008",A3K93OWHKHGI9V,"Water Monkey ""Marc B.""",Clarity and versatility have sold me on this headset,1211328000,Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece - Black - Retail Packaging (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

It comes with three different size plastic (comfortable) tips that you can slide on/off the bluetooth in order to fit in your ear.  And although I was not sure it would work, it does!  Size medium comes on the headset.Setting it up is a breeze.  Although I had to look at the commands for working the volume, etc.It comes with a case, and the case also doubles as a charger!  You can charge the case, and the case will hold one full charge for the headset, so that when you put the headset in the case it will charge...AND it will not overcharge so you don't have to worry about overcharging the battery!  Naturally it comes with a AC charge cable to connect to the case or you can directly charge the headset.The case is a hard case with a puffy outside that feels good in your hand (one of those cases you like to squeeze).Wearing the headset it took me a while to adjust the headset towards my mouth.  Otherwise I sounded like I was talking from a tunnel.  And here is where I took one star away as I found that if I did not position it properly people had a difficult time hearing me.

With my phone turned on, but not being used(and with screen off), it charged my Droid battery from 20% up to 70%.  So on a Droid, this will give you about 50% more power(if charging while phone is not being used).I find that to be bearable.  I would have liked it to provide a complete charge, but the droid has a higher mAh(1300), so I didn't expect it to do that.  All in all, it provided power to the phone, plus a charge of 50%, not bad at all, and it completes its needed task of making my phone last a full day without needing to be plugged in!The next step for these devices will be to make a one that has the USB socket still, but also a couple 'snap out' connectors, like a micro and mini usb connector, so cords wouldn't be needed for all devices.  I haven't heard of this happening anytime soon, or at all, but I have heard they are coming out with new models that have higher mAh(~2000) soon, so that will be nice if it is still the same small size!","12 17, 2009",A1V7LAYECKEL8Z,"T.

B00174N3R0,"[10, 11]",2,"After I ordered the Pogo stylus, I learned from several Youtube videos that you can build these yourself for pennies.  So while the Pogo was on its way to me, I did just that.  The review of the Pogo follows, but I need to mention the do-it-yourself version first.  Being an Engineer, I happened to have a bunch of the carbon foam that micro-chips are shipped in, which is the exact same material the Pogo uses.If you hold the foam and brush it against your iPhone, iPad, etc, it works beautifully.  So I tried shaping a piece of the foam into a ball and attached it to the end of a plastic pen.  It didn't work.  No movement at all from the cursor.  You see, the foam completes an electrical circuit between your body and the touchscreen, which is why the barrel of the Pogo is metal.On Youtube, I saw various methods for creating a metal barrrel.  The most intresting is to use a segment of a telescoping antenna.  The only thing I had lying around was an X-acto knife, so I unscrewed and removed the blade from the barrel, and stuffed the foam inside the barrel hole.  Viola!  It stays in place perfectly, and I was able to shape the foam tip into a rounded ball.Now, the reason I mention all of this is NOT to share my arts and crafts skill.  When I got my Pogo, I noticed that I had to push it really hard against the screen to get a consistent response.  If you lightly brush it, it will NOT respond well.  Others have said the same thing.However, my homemade version with the X-acto barrel works like a champ.  Very light touches work consistently.  I wonder if the brushed finish of the Pogo has any coating that is acting as an insulator.  The X-acto barrel is pure, cold metal, and I imagine it is a much better conductor.So, even not comparing the Pogo to my home-made version, I find the Pogo to be not worth the money.  it requires too hard of a contact for my comfort.  I know that eventually the foam tip will lose its spring-feel and I would be scraping the metal of the Pogo barrel against my iPhone.The idea behind the product is great.  Hopefully, Pogo will come out with a version that has a better conducting barrel.  Until then, I highly recommend going to Radio Shack, and buying the cheapest IC they have - just for the packing material.  Make your own stylus, and I bet yours will work better than the Pogo, too.","06 24, 2010",AKKXYLLFVCHGW,Brian Fuchs,"Honestly, not as good as one I built myself",1277337600,Ten One Design Pogo Stylus for iPhone 3G/3GS - Silver

B00174N3R0,"[1, 1]",4,"I picked this stylus up to improve handwriting (signatures) and drawing on the iPhone.  While it does improve them when doing a side-by-side of the two, it's so unreliable that I find myself not using it often at all.You need to hold it a certain way for it to work and I find myself constantly messing with the tip to get it to work. For what I wanted it for (capturing signatures) it just wasn't worth it. I also don't like the fact that it's all aluminum with a tip just stuck on the end - it feels as if it were to come off, the aluminum would just scratch the screen of the iPhone badly.  It's also small enough that it's very easy to use (much smaller than a standard pen). I read the negative reviews before buying it but passed them off as ""they were probably just using it wrong"" or ""they're just exaggerating on how bad it is."" I wish I had listened!UPDATE 7/28/2010 - After using this a bit more on the iPad, I have to upgrade my review. I've moved it from a 3 to a 4. My gripe with it before was that it was laggy on the original iPhone - drawing/signing too quickly resulted in sharp, straight lines (so a signature looked nothing like how it should, since you sign faster with the Pogo than you would with your finger). On the iPad, it's much more responsive and works better. If you need to ""sign"" stuff or do a little touch-up work on a drawing, this will work better than a finger. For older devices (like the older iPod Touch and iPhone), you'll be disappointed as the OS can't keep up very well. I still wouldn't recommend using it too much for fear of scratching the screen, but it's a nice, compact item to keep with you.","06 3, 2010",A2ARDVMUGDFED6,MiRSD,Better than a finger.. sometimes,1275523200,Ten One Design Pogo Stylus for iPhone 3G/3GS - Silver

B0018MK2C0,"[1, 1]",2,"One of the known problems with theBlackBerry Storm 9530 Phone, Black (Verizon Wireless)is that using Bluetooth voice-command dialing can lock up the phone, requiring one or more reboots (remove the battery, wait 15 seconds, replace the battery, and wait 4-6 minutes). Many of my Storm problems were resolved by a Verizon support tech who had me use a command to ""wipe"" the device and start over again. I thought I'd start clean and use this headset instead of my Motorola, which is recommended by the Storm manual; the lock-up problem is better, but the phone still locks up occasionally.This headset fits more securely than my oldMotorola H700 Bluetooth Headset, but it takes considerably more pressure to press the control, and there is a longer delay between pressing the control and getting any response on the Storm.

I prefer Nokia's approach with a very small and discrete light.I see the necessity to use the charging case as another downside of 655+.

This is moderately ahead of any of the others i tried even though it is twice or 3 times the price it makes it worth it. However, with the sacrifice of cables you aren't going to get sound like a nice pair of cans. For the convenience and ease of use, I can live with that. If I want to listen to real nice sound I do that at home. These have pretty clean highs and mids, the bass is a less noticeable(but really look at  the size of the things. Overall quality headphones and I think they were worth the price tag.Edit (7/29/12): I have now had these headphones for a year and my opinion of them have greatly increased if that's possible. I was recently looking for workout headphones, the sweat resistant kind and such and then I came to realize. I have been using these ones for runs and going to classes and such (in 100+ degree weather I sweat plenty). These headphones have been used daily during school months and now daily when I go to the gym. I understand it probably wasn't a great idea to test these with activities with sweating so much. But these have lasted me an entire year of heavy sweating as well as rough handling (in backpack and gym bag) and they are still going strong. They may be pricey but they sure are durable as well as higher audio quality than I have heard from most bluetooth headsets. So as I said I kept thinking about getting some headphones advertised as ""sport"" or ""active"" head phones and I just realized today that I have been using these all along and they have none of the drawbacks all the other ones seem to be accumulating aside from being a bit more expensive (Others I looked at ranged $60-$99). Once again, extremely happy with these and if your looking for great wireless headphones and possibly even to work out with I have found them to be the best in every category. On a last note, call quality is livable. People on the other end I have asked have commented that they couldn't tell I was on a headset while others have said it sounded a bit worse than normal so that to me is outstanding when coming from blue tooth mic head sets as they usually have terrible quality mic reception.Edit (3/15/13) Still going strong, just took them off after a long bike ride.

B0019UX796,"[1, 1]",2,"1.  I'm on my third pair of these headphones;  thankfully i only purchased them once, but Sennheiser has been a solid company and as sent me two brand new units.2.  Bottomline, these headphones are great sounding wireless / bluetooth headphones, they fit well (at least my head) and are easy to operate.  However, as with all wireless headphones, they are overtly inferior to the traditional wired headphones in terms of sound quality and volume (huge issue with me).  Furthermore, compared to the ""BT"" wireless line in Sennheiser, this unit is overtly inferior in terms of sound and especially build quality.  So getting to my main point (sorry for taking so long), all in all a nice pair of wireless phones (ie you should have a specific purpose for a wireless set over a traditional wired set).  The problem with this specific line is that they're poorly made.  The on / off button is... lame.  Specifically, it's difficult to tell if you're pressing down on the button properly.  Ok, so what one may say and I agree.  Clarifying statement in terms of the poorly made:  I have send back two units because one unit would not turn off (I tried every trick in the book, but the button was stuck or something else was going on)  The other unit wouldn't turn on consistently.  There would be days where it would work properly and then other days when the darn thing wouldn't powerup (yes, the headphones were fully fully charged).3.  Thus, unless you specifically require this type / shape of headphones (which I do), then I would strongly recommend going with the higher priced but definitely much better Sennheiser wireless phones (ex: the BT line, which are truely 5 star products).4.  On a side note: Kudos to Sennheiser for being a 5 star company;  no questions asked, no hassles, they're a company that stands behind their products and puts out excellent stuff... most of the time.","01 6, 2012",APBB297H3ZA5E,Harry M.

I'll get this out of the way first, these Sennheisers are by far my favorite of the BT headsets I bought. They are very clean with more than enough volume to overcome outside noise, should you so desire. However, these are over the ear headphones, designed to allow you to hear the world around you. A bit safer for running/walking/biking on a high traffic area.Sound quality wise, these are exactly what I would expect from Sennheiser. Extremely detailed and clean. These aren't for the bassheads however, as the bass could stand to be a bit more pronounced. That being said, my sole testing platform is an iPhone 3gs, which is known for a very flat frequency response. But don't get me wrong, the bass is MUCH better than the Moto S305's and a few other cans and IEM's around the same price point. It's just not what one would call ""boomy"". For those that prefer lifelike reproduction, the way the engineer intended, these should be fairly pleasing.Build quality isn't the best I've seen and could stand to be improved. The neckband feels as if it will snap if stressed too much. They also aren't as comfortable as the other two Motos, as the they kind of pinch the ear when worn as intended. I actually can only have the right side ""clipped"" to my ear, as the left side feels way to awkward and somewhat painful when attached. This actually affects sound quality a bit, as it's not fully on the ear. Each person has different ears, so others may not have this problem.I had no problem pairing these with my iPhone 3gs. Everything synced up perfectly and other than charging, worked straight from the box. The only thing that doesn't work with Apple products is the track forward/track backward buttons. However, this isn't a problem with the headphones themselves, but an Apple intended limitation to sell more dock licenses. Guess they don't have enough money. If you have an external bluetooth adapter that attaches to the dock connector (like the one that comes with the S9-HD's), all the buttons, including track forward/track backward work fine. But this kind of defeats the purpose of having on-board bluetooth.In conclusion, I definitely like these, but they're not what I would call perfect. They would probably be 5-star phones IF they were under $100. The fit and finish, along with the mildly-anemic bass response keeps them at a 4-star level. Again, the bass response is definitely not terrible and a lot more pronounced that some others, it's just not going to please the bassheads out there looking for BT phones.","10 23, 2010",A27B1U3OWCU14J,Method2Madness &#34;Alex&#34;,Above average Bluetooth Stereo Headset.,1287792000,Sennheiser MM 100 Bluetooth Headset - Black/Gray

I always had Sony Ericssons in the past and didn't have a problem, even though most other people did with their Motorolas, Nokias, etc.  My office-mate may get a signal here and there but it always cuts out pretty quickly.  I used to have no issue until I switched from Sony Ericsson to Samsung (unfortunately, I didn't like the Sony Ericsson Xperia).I wanted to get the Cell Ranger USB powered signal booster, but it was priced way higher than this one.  I bought the in-vehicle booster and also got a dc/ac converter so I could use it in my office.  I have found that I have to be right by the base/power part --- I mean within a foot.  I have it hanging from an overhead cabinet on my wall.  It rests in the air about a foot or so above my desk and I leave my phone under it.  I get 2-4 bars this way when I wasn't getting any signal at all before.Because of the need to be so close to the base, I would think that you would definitely need a bluetooth to use the phone in the car so that you could keep the phone right next to the power supply/base.  I definitely recommend this signal booster as long as you understand the limitations and they would work for you, because it DOES increase the signal significantly.","09 29, 2010",A3N4CUW4UYC9I3,MH,Works in the way I need/use it.,1285718400,Cell Ranger Stix 8811960A Plug and Talk Dual Band In-Vehicle Wireless Portable Amplifier

B001B1BKZ6,"[1, 1]",4,"I purchased this product in my local Apple store, and luckily there was a sales clerk there who knew how to get the film affixed to the iPhone.  It would have taken me three times as long to get near the same results.This is how he did it: He thoroughly cleaned my iPhone with a cleaning solution and a clothe, getting rid of all the smudges and specks of dust. Then he took out and handled one of the films with two fingers, one each on the vertical sides of the film. He then lined up the two holes in the film (one for the speaker and one for the home button) and he carefully let the film affix to the glass. When he spotted a tiny bubble, he slightly pulled up the film and reset it again. He used the clothe to further affix the film to the glass.The trick was to make sure there were no smudges or specks of dust on the glass. Clean it thoroughly.Needless to say, the film does not have the same smooth feel as the glass. You'll have to get used to the difference. And though the film requires less cleaning and doesn't get as much smudges as the glass, it still requires cleaning.The film fits the class very nicely, and there's not too much difference in the overall viewing of video or images on the iPhone. I would prefer not to use the film, but I just found myself always wiping away annoying smudges from the glass.","04 11, 2009",A2J0IBS4PFRO2C,Bakari Chavanu,Good product; tricky to put on,1239408000,Power Support Anti-Glare Film Set for iPhone (Original)

B001B1BKZ6,"[2, 2]",5,"I've used protective films like this on other phones and was always disappointed with them.  I saw this in the Apple store, asked about it, thought about it, read about it, then went ahead and bought it.  It's insurance, right?  Do you ever get your insurance money back?In this case, Lord, I hope not.  It was money well INVESTED.Think of all the other things you buy insurance for, car, home, boat, motorcycle.  We buy covers for our barbeque grills and netting to deer-proof azaleas, and this is cheap by comparison.I have to say I'm pretty facile when it comes to using things like this; it wasn't much of a problem to clean the screen in a relatively dust-free area of the house.  We own: two HUGE german shepherd dogs, a shiba inu, an umbrella cockatoo, four finches and a green-cheek conure, two large bearded dragons who also shed perpetually, and there are two adults and two teens in the house.  We could open a store called ""Dust is Us,"" and clean up... ahem.  This was also the peak of grass pollen season.I was really surprised and relieved that I didn't get a single speck of lint/dust/hair under the film after I put it on, peeled it off to reposition, put it on, peeled it off to reposition and get the air bubbles out.  On and off three times.  I THINK the trick (if I had it to do all over again) is to start with the LONG side of the screen then work across.  Forget about getting the button hole centered.PROS:- cheap insurance.  works.  I have a ""Shield"" back cover (the semi-sticky kind) and with the film I can just put the phone in my front pocket and pull it out when I need it.  Occasionally I've put my keys in the same pocket and if the iPhone screen COULD have been scratched, it would have been.  But I have the film.- easier to apply than it sounds or others have suggested.  It's not chewing gum, doing tensor calculus and riding a skateboard on a humpback whale during breeching season, but it's a little harder than, say, hitting the snooze button on your clock.- it really sticks, and without anything sticky.  See CONS below.CONS:IF you use postits for shopping lists (or a day planner.  just ask me), and you put it in the same pocket as your iPhone, DON'T!  The reason post-its are so popular, the reason they work so well, is that the adhesive doesn't work that well.  Believe me, it does.  It sticks to this film like love-bugs on a radiator in summer. (oblique living in hell - um, Florida - reference there, no offense meant).  The post-it comes off, the adhesive stays.  It's a real bear to remove, too.  IF you use a strip of cellophane tape (scotch or box), the film comes right off the screen first.  Again, I pressed it down and then peeled off the tape and postit residue obliquely in the same plane as the film.  worked fine.  And again, no dust under the screen.LESSONS LEARNED:a 1/2 inch piece of tape will effectively peel back the film without damaging it if you need to get that speck of dust out from under the film.  But make sure your house is full of dog, bird and lizard dander and dust mites and pollen before even trying to apply this, or you might get a single speck somewhere that'll bug the heck out of you for years (or the next generation comes along).This is a good product, and cheaper here (no tax or shipping, either) than at the Apple Store.

It ads very little to the form factor of the iPhone, has held up well and looks good. Most folks at first glance can't tell there is a protector on it. Moreover, it is far superior to silicone cases and flip cases in my opinion.When I first unpackaged and slid it onto the phone, I was skeptical that it would stay put or last long. After 3-weeks of this thing being thrown in pockets, on tables as I enter meetings, dropped on the ground a few times, etc. It hasn't lost it's look, grip to the phone or touch.

They look just as they did when they came out of the box from the AT&T; store.It allows easy access to the entire screen, there's just enough of an edge on the front to protect it on a face-first drop, but doesn't have the obnoxious 'over cover' on the bottom and top of the front like some other cases, and easy access to all buttons (while also being protected from drops) plus you can dock it if you have one.It is a simple, elegant design that just works.I personally don't like flip cases - just get in the way. I use it too much to have to keep flipping and holding open. Also, I didn't use the included film. I prefer the stick-on kind (takes a few extra minutes, but you don't have to worry about dust, moving around and scratching the screen, etc.)I suspect that I will wear this out eventually so have an extra on hand should Griffin decided (for some strange reason) to quit making these.","09 7, 2008",ADHR5QDBFP91Q,Enigma,Best phone case I have owned across all phones,1220745600,"Griffin Elan form Case with EasyDock for iPhone 3G, 3G S (Black)"

I have been thru MANY iphone cases trying to find the best one. I think I was a little obsessive about it.Avoid all the silicone / rubber cases, they look nice, they grip well but they ALL stretch some over time. What starts our as a snug glove - tight fit loosens a lot until it squishes around the unit like its made 1 size too big. The hard shell case is the way to go. they don't stretch. Try to get one with a ""grippy"" surface as opposed to the slick ones that make the iphone prone to flying out of your hand.The Pros - fits perfectly, bottom locks into the top and you have one seamless fit. It says you can take the bottom off to dock but I bet this will fit in my Sony clock radio just fine as ia. Nice grip-able leather surface & feels good to hold. The sides are just shallow enough to not get in the way of your fingers as you type but enough that if you turn it face down the glass won't be touching the surface. The cut outs for the top and side buttons is well done, your fingers find the buttons easily without looking.The Cons: Just the weird poly-carbonate shield it ships with. It might turn out to be awesome but I am used to the very clingy type of stick-on shield. This one is much thicker and you can take it off and re-apply. There's a lot of glare caused by this new shield and it seems to attract prints more. I guess the upside is I can take it off and wash it and put it back on. I will say tho, while looking at the iphone straight on I can't really see any difference. Its mainly when looking at it from the side or when its off. Anyways, I can easily buy some regular press on screens if I don't like this one but I like the idea of thicker and re-useable.Its also a little tricky when you slide the bottom on to make sure the screen cover and such are all in the right grooves, its that reason I'd prefer to not take the bottom off any more than I have to.So, wow - maybe my search for the perfect case is over.

B001BF12QO,"[9, 9]",4,"I bought this battery pack because I routinely run the battery on my iPhone down below 20%. I did not want to buy a battery-in-a-case solution such as the Mophie Juicepack because I have read many reviews that point to the fact that these battery-case solutions can significantly dampen the phone's ability to receive signal. The Satechi pack is a small battery that allows me to recharge my iPhone on the fly up to two times before it needs recharging, and it's relatively small footprint means I can carry it anywhere I go. Charging it can take over an hour. Just make sure you use a powered USB hub, or, of using a laptop, make sure you use the main USB port, that draws more power. If not, you will not be able to recharge the pack to full charge, and it will overheat the USB cord quickly. Finally, you can use the iPhone's own charger to recharge the battery, but only the old style, larger charger. The newer, smaller charger (sold with the newer iPhone 3GS) is not powerful enough to handle the power draw of the battery pack as it charges, and all it will do is overheat significantly while the indicator lights on the battery flash and the battery never really charges, which can potentially be a problem. So make sure whatever USB adapter you use to charge the battery has enough power output and draw to allow the pack to charge safely.","03 30, 2010",AW1OGWTQAW85,Javier Ruiz,good battery extender for iPhone 3GS,1269907200,"Satechi iCel 5200 mAh (2 amp) Battery Extender Pack and Charger for iPhone 6, 5, 5S, 5C, 4, HTC One, Nexus 5, DROID, Samsung Galaxy S4, S5, S6, S6 Edge, Note 3, 2, Flip & Vado HD Camcorders"

DO NOT attempt to use with a car charger, wall charger, etc. unless you confirm that it puts out ONLY 500 mA, and no more.  See [UPDATE] section below, for more details. ***[Capacity summary: was able to (carefully!) charge my Droid X **which has an extended internal battery with 20% more capacity** 1.3 times.  If product worked as advertised, I should have been able to charge at least 2.3 times, assuming my Li-ion phone battery is at the poor end of the charging-efficiency spectrum.  Would expect at least 2.7 charges for Droid X with regular (non-extended) internal battery.]Overall design is very nice; it looks very nice, shape is good, very attractive.  But... several problems.First, this battery was supposed to be in 'new' condition, but was very clearly (and heavily) pre-used; the box had stains, sticky stuff, and extra circular stickers on it (from where the previous 'owner' broke the seal).Second, it didn't work.  My phone (Droid X with genuine Motorola extended battery BH6X, which holds 1800 mAh instead of the usual 1500) could only charge from it a total of about 1.3 times, before the external battery was totally drained.  I was surprised, so I repeated the test, and got the same results.  I was super careful: I let the external battery charge for 36 hours; I waited til my phone was down to 30%; then I charged it up to 100% (cell was on; gps/wireless off; all tasks killed; screen off/no activity).  I then disconnected the external battery right away, when the phone reached 100%.I then repeated the process; I plugged the phone into the external battery at 30%.  About two hours later, it was at 70%, but the external battery was 100% drained.Very disappointing performance.  It was only able to transfer 45% of its alleged  energy to the Droid X (1800 x 1.3 = 2340 mAh, out of 5200), but Wikipedia says that Li ion should be able to charge at 80-90% efficiency -- so something is clearly wrong here.I would stay away; I was worried when I bought it, noticing that many recent reviews (as of April 2011) had complained of the same.  I think they're selling a bunch of their returned units.  This really irks me, as I'm extremely busy, and really don't have time for this kind of stuff; I want to just buy a product that works and lasts, and I'm happy to pay whatever it takes.[UPDATE]Satechi contacted me.  They claim that smart phone chargers provide too many amps, and that this fries the external battery.  They recommend *only* charging from a laptop (where the USB is limited to 0.5A), whereas I used (in my two tests) chargers with 850 and 1000 amps.However, this is no excuse; this is a design defect.  You should be able to charge from any source, as long as it has at least 500 mA.  Every other electronics device on the planet has circuitry to limit the amperage it takes in to what it needs, and gracefully rejects excess current.  They tried very hard over the phone to convince me that this was not a design defect; I found this very disingenuous.

Then the same USB cable could be flipped over to charge the phone; in my case, I had to use an additional mini USB to micro USB charging adapter. So 1 cable, 1 bat-ext, 1 adapter, all in a single pouch. A+ for compact. A+ for simplicity and nice touch on the little status button that tells you how much juice is left. Industrial Design: Clean line and 'Apple' like although the enclosure squeaks a little when it's being squeeze. And because of the shining effect, expect fingerprints magnet! Buff the prints off using the soft case, and it looks marvelous! Overall, well built and no gap, which show excellent workmanship and attention to details. Markings are sharp and no blemish found. Don't know about how safe it is as there is no UL Listing Mark on it; could be a concern for a rechargeable Li-Ion battery, which is known to go 'Kaboom' when being over-charged. Has some weight feel to it...feel like it's stocky! Good, I am expecting beefy juice out of this bad boy!Since it's full charge 8 days ago, it now has lost one green LED without being used. Assuming that the unit discharges linearly, it would take 8*5=40 days to completely discharge... Recognizing that this a false assumption and theoretically at best, so don't go jumping all over me now! I will give the unit another 8 days to check if it would lose another LED. Then loading and cycling tests of the unit will begin. Stay tune.Update Jan 2013 - After 2 years of using this device, it has paid for itself many times over. The battery appears to reach it's life cycle so I have to charge it more often to ensure I have backup power while traveling. It's still a nice unit when it was introduced at the time... simple to use, just remember to plug it in the night before your trip to have a full charge ready for use.... today there are many similar options to choose from other companies, and there are newer models from the same company... worth a second look.","12 7, 2010",A2L6I0ZLGKO2ND,"Tinkeringeek ""Tinkeringeek""",Very Neat Little Power Brick,1291680000,"Satechi iCel 5200 mAh (2 amp) Battery Extender Pack and Charger for iPhone 6, 5, 5S, 5C, 4, HTC One, Nexus 5, DROID, Samsung Galaxy S4, S5, S6, S6 Edge, Note 3, 2, Flip & Vado HD Camcorders"

B001CI741M,"[4, 5]",2,"I wish there had been some reviews to read before I bought this!  Basically, it does what it says.  It protects your privacy.  No one can see the screen unless they're pretty much directly in front of it.However... this is a two-piece set.  It comes with a glossy screen protector that protects the whole front of the iphone.  You're supposed to put that down first, then put the privacy film on top of it.  I did it backwards, and that screwed everything up.But even if you did it right, here are the four problems associated with it:1. the film is quite thick - try to picture this - it's about 3 times as thick as the glossy screen protector (the standard screen protector that comes with or without the privacy film).  Keep in mind the glossy screen protector is super thin and when you have that on your phone you hardly notice it.  The privacy film though is thick enough that it creates a ridge that your finger can definitely feel as it runs across it.(By the way, the privacy film just covers the lighted part of the iphone screen - not the entire face).  So the privacy film sits on top of the glossy screen protector - and there's this ridge there.  A ridge that can get caught on things when you put the phone in your pocket or purse.  I'm sure it won't last long in daily use.I accidentally installed all of this backwards from the way they recommended.  I put the privacy film down first, then the glossy protector on top of it.  It works okay, and it eliminates the ""ridge"" problem.  The film will now not get caught on anything and ripped off because it's covered by the glossy protector.  However, the glossy protector doesn't fit over it perfectly - leaving a lot of bubbles outside of the screen area.  This is no doubt why they recommend installing it the other way around!2. The privacy film really dims your screen.3. With this doubling up of films and protectors the screen loses a noticeable amount of sensitivity, and you have to press harder for it to recognize your commands.  This is really a pain after awhile.4. The privacy film got a tiny little bubble that just won't go away.  I can push it around with my thumb, but it just comes back when I'm finished!It sounds like a great idea in theory, but I'm not sure in practice it's really going to be worth it.  I find myself now weighing the benefits & costs.Benefit:  no one can see my screen but meCosts:  I have to look at a much darker screen, there are little bubbles that can't be removed, and the whole thing's not going to last very long anyway!Then I think:  privacy protection sounds good, but really - in real life - how often has my privacy been violated by someone looking at my screen?  I'm not sure it has ever happened.  And if it did happen, it has caused me no harm.  So why not just be careful whose around when you pull the phone out and dump the whole privacy film bit!","05 13, 2009",A1Z67I4KAH1V4N,Jonathan,Does what it says but causes other problems,1242172800,Green Onions Supply Glossy Screen Protector for iPhone 3GS & 3G - 2 Pieces per Pack

That's the lesson I learned from buying non-licensed Apple accessories (fortunately it was a cheap lesson).Committed to not paying the outrageous sum of 50 dollars for the Apple av cable (since I knew they could make them for less than $5), I started to look for the cheapest licensed cable. The Scosche fit the bill for about half of the Apple cable (although a lot more than the generic and without the charging feature of either). A compromise... yes, but I really like to be able to share photos and videos when on the road, and the ability to watch movies on the TV is nice too.With the iPod touch and this cable, you can: play movies, video podcasts, and photo slideshows.You can NOT with this and the iPod touch: display the current screen (I don't think any do), pick a single photo from the gallery (you need to start the show and go next... next... next... until you get there) and you can't play plain music (you could get a headphone to RCA adapter cheap though if that's what you wanted to do).I've since upgraded again to 3.1.1 and it still works.

(I.e. one yellow cable for video and a red and white cable for left and right audio).  It has a micro-usb power input, so if you have a micro-usb cable, you can power your device while it's running video or audio.Within a week, I was no longer getting a reliable connection - I would have to wiggle the cable or carefully put things under the cable to raise it relative to the iphone, or wouldn't get output.  A few weeks after that, and I can't get a connection at all.  I don't know if it's a manufacturing issue, a design issue, or if the weight of the cable just degrades the connection after a while.  Maybe a dock would be a better choice.  If you buy this, I would recommend saving the packaging in case you need a return.Another word of caution: under the standard Apple operating system, not all applications support ""video out"" through the port at the bottom of the device.  For example, Netflix currently supports video out for the iphone 4 and ipad, but not for earlier iphones or for ipods.  So you can't take a factory spec device and expect to mirror the home screen or anything like that, but you can play the stuff that the Apple operating system wants you to play.I have a ""jailbroken"" iphone 3g running tvout2 mirror, a non istore app that mirrors all output to the cable.  Using that, Netflix runs great on my 3g with this cable, at least when the cable is working.

The solution was to use Safari to get to YouTube and play the videos off the net.Based on these facts I'm sure there are other restrictions you will run into, but right now I have a very clear picture on an older Sony TV (not LCD) and great audio.

How long does it take to put it in an envelope and mail it?  Apparently 5 days!  It's so hard having a Amazon Prime Membership and paying for crappy service when Prime isn't offered.Case:The case is lightweight and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone.  After the first night of use I noticed that the USB cable didn't really fit in the slot.  The USB cable will not fit in secure enough to stay.  After looking at it closer, looks like the space below the USB slot has plenty of space cut out, but the space above the top just barely clears the slot.  So I'm guessing you have to make sure it's in there, or it will just fall out.The power button is a little hard to press with the case on.  I bought this case as a temporary solution until Otterbox comes out with a case (in Blue on July 14th).  Once I get a better case, I will be putting this case in a drawer.Edit: 9-28-13The case has completely fallen apart.  The black ring has come apart from the clear back.

In terms of ""feel,"" they are somewhat like a TPU case (not as hard as plastic, yet not soft like silicone).  The ridges on the side make gripping of the case feel very secure. No fear of phone slipping out of my hand.  All cutouts are perfectly aligned.  It adds very minimal bulk. Allows easy sliding in/out of pocket and leather holster.  In terms of installing/removing, it is moderately easy.  Removal requires some work but nothing to be worried about.  Best to remove it from the bottom, as removing the case from the top takes the back of the S3 with it.One negative observation:  the black case was not as snug around the entire phone as the white one.  It protruded out slightly on the right side.  Seemed as though the area surrounding the power button was not cut properly, so the case did not rest tightly against the side.

B001E8Q8XA,"[0, 0]",2,"I liked the idea of a screen protector since I constantly carry my iPhone with me and didn't want it to get scratched.  That said, the screen protector became so gross overtime that I HAD to peel it off.  What do I mean by gross?  The edges of the sticker seemed to attract makeup, dust and other gunk making the phone look VERY unsanitary.  Even when I tried putting my phone in a separate clean pocket, it still picked things up whenever I put it up to my face to talk.  If you're purely using the headphones or a bluetooth device this may be less of an issue for you.  However, as someone who wears make up and was constantly picking it up this was a big issue for me.  It especially had a tendency to collect around the button and was virtually impossible to clean off.Now that I have removed the protector this is no longer a problem.  I find that it doesn't seem to attract makeup anymore and even when it does I can easily clean it off with a gentle cloth.  I also haven't had any issues with scratches and dents, despite regular use, making the think the screen is durable enough on its own.The bottom line is that I would recommend this if you are putting it up to your cheek to talk and wear makeup because it can get gross pretty fast and is hard to clean.","05 28, 2009",AHN86VFJIJ2JP,Chicago Book Addict,"Good at first, but can get gunky over time",1243468800,DB Premium iPhone 3G Full LCD Screen Protector - 3 Pack

B001E8Q8XA,"[1, 1]",5,"I just picked up 3 packages of these when I finally decided to replace my current screen protector (it's the same as these, and has lasted since August 2008). With three in each pack, I figure I won't have to buy another set until my next phone. :-)The protector itself is much sturdier than screen protectors you may have used in the past (for an iPod or Palm, for example). It's not the flimsy, flexible stuff. For example, if a standard screen protector that you'd get at a big box store was the equivalent flexibility of a sheet of notebook paper, then this one would be the equivalent of a business card.The upshot of this is that you don't have to worry about corners folding or bubbles forming during application. You can position it very precisely before applying, and then when you apply, you get a PERFECT result, straight with no bubbles whatsoever (assuming you take a little care, of course, and clean/dry the screen and wipe off any dust or particulate matter before applying).The fact that it's covered on both sides is very nice, so if you feel like it (though it's not really necessary because of its stiffness), you can use a credit card to press it down as you apply the protector without scratching the protector surface with the card. To be honest though, it doesn't seem to scratch that easy anyway. It's FAR less prone to scratches than any other screen protector I have ever used.I see absolutely no evidence of the rainbow, oily pattern that a couple of people have complained about.  I guess it's possible that there was a bad batch, or maybe the problem was solved, but these protectors look great and have no tint, discoloration, or anything of that nature.So you get a high quality, crystal clear, bubble-free, scratch resistant protector that will easily outlast a normal screen protector, and will probably outlast a PACK of normal screen protectors. And you basically get it for the cost of shipping.Remember, I had one on before I bought this most recent set, and it was on the screen from August 2008 until April 2009. It's a no-brainer. Get it and thank me later. :-)","04 14, 2009",A2N75ADJSRW0AH,Jeff Kraus,"Clear, Strong, No Bubbles == Awesome",1239667200,DB Premium iPhone 3G Full LCD Screen Protector - 3 Pack

You pay a penny and less then three bucks for shipping to get three screen protectors that are even supposed to be reusable (although, I doubt you can really wash and reuse them).  I've gone through at least three different brands of protectors and these rank just behind the one that came with a Marware case I bought.  Similar to the Marware one, these are a little thicker than some others I've had and nice a glossy.  If you get it on without bubbles you can't even tell it is there.  Speaking of bubbles, you just have to be careful.  The protector doesn't make bubbles the person applying the protector allows bubbles if you aren't careful.  I actually think the thickness of these helps you put it on easier without bubbles.  The top sheet that needs to be pulled off once applied is nice so that you can run your scrapper card (You do have one of those, right.  If not, no wonder you are getting bubbles.  Try using a credit card at least) against it pretty aggressively to prevent and remove any bubbles.

B001EN109C,"[0, 0]",4,"This device is pretty easy to use and the quality is very good, I've even used it in a noisy delivery van and had good results.It has a feature where it will broadcast audio to your car's radio instead of the built-in speaker.  This works about as well as most FM modulators (like the ones available for MP3 players).  It is pretty reliable once you find that perfect frequency, but as soon as you drive outside of your city, you must find a frequency that works well at your destination. I use the FM feature only when I'm in my home city and then use the built in speaker for traveling outside my city. If you don't find a nice quiet empty spot on your FM dial, static is really bad and audio will cut out occasionally, forcing you to use the built in speaker.  I was very pleased to discover that the iPhone 3GS will not only broadcast calls to the device via bluetooth, it sends all system audio to your Jabra, including music, podcasts, and message alerts.  I keep my iPhone on a charger and stow it in the console, and can listen to music from it over my radio, and take calls as they come in.Voice dialing works really well, even better than when using the wired headset that was included with my iPhone 3GS.Battery life is very good.  I've been using it for two weeks without charging it and it performs as well as it did with a full charge (in two weeks I've made or taken probably 30 short calls with it and sent hours of music to my radio from the iphone with it).  I'm a little bit worried that it my suffer some battery life issues this winter because the included documentation states that the battery may not hold a charge if stored at below freezing temps. It charges via USB and the package includes a USB car charger adapter (which also works with an iphone cable) and a USB-to-miniUSB cable for charging the Jabra.","10 31, 2009",A3I04RM049YS8Y,Jeffrey Stanley,"Speakerphone works great with iPhone, FM transmitter is a bit weak",1256947200,Jabra SP700 Bluetooth Speakerphone (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

If you put the SP700 in the back seat closer to your ""built into the glass"" antenna then the receptionimproves since local stations usually give you static with most transmitters.BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE !!!Where I live I dont get clear AM reception of the NY news stations like 1010WINS or CBS880, so I have a Cirago Bluetooth adaptor that I got off newegg for 14$,I go to the web site, start the streaming radio, then put it out through the bluetooth to my Jabra SP700, hit the FM button, and then my little radio in the bathroom has clearsignal for the news radio, and I can hear all the news while getting ready in the bathroom in the morning.Between the bluetooth and the FM transmitter you can stream any audio from your computer to most parts of your home.The Jabra SP700 has a bunch of great uses.Hope you enjoy yours as much as I do mine.","08 27, 2009",A1CWJ7WFM30C0U,J.

Wouldn't sync with my wife's iPod Touch though, not sure why not.Good price here, about half of the MSRP. Only beef is that the listing does not tell you that it is bulk packaging. It has all the parts and the manual, but just comes loose. No biggie but makes me think it might be a refurb or something. Just would have been nice to know.","03 29, 2010",A1RIVGXTRWO8EE,J.

B001EN109C,"[1, 1]",5,"I picked this speakerphone up at Costco and have had it clipped on my visor, in daily operation, for over three years.The profile is low and the weight is light, so it's no problem flipping my visor around to block out the sun when needed (though I can't really use the speakerphone after having done so).The charging jack is USB micro, allowing me to keep just one charger in my center console for both my phone and speakerphone. But the battery only requires recharging once every three or four weeks. It's just as easy to slip the Jabra into my pocket and bring it inside to charge off the computer's USB port, when the time comes. The unit gives a verbal warning when the battery is low, and unfortunately, the notice is short, so there's not much use left after the first warning comes and the ""depleted battery"" LED illuminates.Pairing couldn't be simpler. And frankly, once it's paired, it doesn't need to be touched again. I've used my with Blackberry 9530 Storm and 9550 Storm 2, without a hiccup. Voice dialing commands are easily recognized by the Jabra, and if there's every a problem (occasionally it gets stuck in the voice dial menu), it appears to be the phone's fault, not the speakerphone's.Voice quality is excellent. I never get complaints that my voice is inaudible or unclear, and the volume pumping out of the Jabra's speaker is loud and good quality. By comparison, I use a hard-wired Parrot system with a separate mic, speaker and control module at work, and while the Parrot's vehicle-powered speaker is louder, I don't find that complex system as a whole any more usable than the SP700.If there's one complaint, it's that this speakerphone appears as an ""Audio Sink"" device (shouldn't that be ""audio sync""??) and sometimes my BlackBerry chooses to pair with it instead of myBlackBerry Bluetooth Stereo Gatewaydevice, which interfaces with my car's stereo. To prevent this, I have to make sure to start my car prior to powering on the Jabra, allowing the Stereo Gateway to power up and pair with the phone first. Doing so makes everything work correctly for the rest of my car time, even in instances where I'm running errands, in and out of the car, where the Stereo Gateway constantly is switched on and off yet the Jabra remains powered on.And the BlackBerry has no problem referring all phone calls to the Jabra while directing Pandora music to the Stereo Gateway.While I'd prefer to have a built-in speaker phone with no charging or sun visor usage issues, the reality is I've installed a ""built in"" speakerphone in my wife's car, and a mic problem resulted in a problem that took a whole lot of interior disassembly work to correct. There's certainly something to be said about combining all the parts of a speakerphone into one small, reliable package.","04 26, 2011",A2K5RRMPICZ606,Nathaniel Allen,Quite pleased after 3+ years of use...,1303776000,Jabra SP700 Bluetooth Speakerphone (Discontinued by Manufacturer)
B001EN109C,"[17, 17]",5,"My brother gave me a Jabra for Christmas.  My phone was so old, it did not have Bluetooth technology and I went out to get a new phone just so I could use it.  Well, I'm glad I did.  The only time I need to talk hands-free is in the car.  This is perfect for that.The Jabra is wonderful.  It's sleek and thin, doesn't obstruct my vision when on the visor.  It was quick and easy to set up and use.  When calls come in, I only need to touch it to answer.  No more fumbling for my phone.  The sound is crisp and clear.  I talk mostly to my husband on it and he says the sound is clear on his end.  My kids talk to him from the back of the minivan and he can hear them, too.  I much prefer it to the earpiece, which I had to worry about falling out of my ear and gave listeners on the other end an echo.  It's also preferable to the speakerphone function of the cellphone.This is a wonderful gadget -- one of those nice to have, makes my life easy sort of things.  I'm glad I own it.UPDATE:  The battery life is remarkable.  It's been three months and I've only charged it once.  Admittedly, I only turn it on to make or accept calls about once a week, but most rechargeable batteries discharge over time even without use.  Still haven't found any problems with this product.

There's a big scratch along the edge of my phone now, because the SHIELD left so much unprotected, and unfortunately my sleek new iPhone is now a scratched up iPhone.I guess for the much more careful, this is a fine case to buy.

However, don't count on much protection for your phone, even on the back where the Apple logo is exposed -- one wrong move with your car keys in your purse or pocket and you'll end up with a big scratch along the back too.I've since changed my case out to something with more coverage, and I'm happier using that instead.","03 9, 2009",A106Q1A6LGU4DP,gnapye,Not much protection,1236556800,SHIELD Apple 3G iPhone Shield Polycarbonate Slim Fit Case + Microfiber Cleaning Cloth - (Champagne)

Sure, if you cover it, it won't get scratched, but you don't buy a sports car to keep it in the garage so it doesn't get a rock chip!  If I wanted the chrome covered, I would have purchased a different case.The volume and vibrate buttons are slightly (and I stress slightly) harder to access due to the shield going across both sides of the buttons, but they are also protected from accidental pushing.What I like best about this case is the feel.  It's got a nice grippy texture without being overly rubbery.  It easily slides in and out of my pocket, but allows better grip than a naked iPhone (I was always afraid my phone would slide out of my hand, it's so slippery).  Excellent material.Great case.

B001GJ0E4G,"[0, 0]",4,"I initially purchased this device in 2008 from AT&T when it just came out and changed 3 of them since that time. First had a problem with trackball after couple of months of use. The other one had dead pixels on the screen. So I am on my third device now.  My primary aim for this device is usage of chat software(IM+), emails and internet browsing (Opera Mini). This is by far is one of the best and user friendly devices I have used. It is not laggy as windows mobile devices, The menus can be accessed quickly with no delays. And especially multitasking (which iphone lacks) is a very nice feature that has been helping me a lot while chatting, making a phone call, and watching a video or listening to the music at the same time. Of course I had to update it with the latest firmware update. Before that, I had some java errors and spontaneous reboots, but not anymore. Since the last update I can confirm that I had NO problems whatsoever. I have few complaints though which in my opinion are minor ones and I can live with them. First is the battery life. If I am not using internet very often it may last a day and a half but when I am browsing with Opera Mini or chatting on IM+ the battery drains very quickly so I have to carry another battery with me. Another thing I would prefer to have is a nice youtube player which I can't find anywhere (I tryed a couple of them). And the youtube that plays with a native browser is just garbage, which is kind of sad because other phones like Iphone and HTC touch pro 2 can play youtube quite nicely. And last but not least is the camera. Outdoors, on the bright light you can get more or less decent pictures but if you will try to shoot a video it will come out as a total crap, pixelated with distorted lighting. And the flash isn't helping much either. Unlike for example with Nokia n97 which takes pretty decent pictures and videos. But like I said these things are minor ones and since this phone is being oriented more for a business user you can't expect to have it all. Especially I like the ability to operate this device with one hand only, which comes in handy in many situations, unlike some other phones with larger keyboards I have tried. Of course another nice feature is a multilanguage support which you can not have in windows mobile phones (e.g. convert device and keyboard interface in spanish, german or other language at no charge) Now I am only expecting the release of OS 5.0 which I will immediately install on my device. So let's see how that goes. I definitely recommend Blackberry Bold for someone who is searching for a device with push email, chatting and light internet use.","10 28, 2009",A27XZ2EQ8VUT7Y,AAlt,Great device!,1256688000,RIM Blackberry Bold 9000 (Unlocked) - BLACK
B001GJ0E4G,"[23, 24]",4,"I've been using Blackberries since a blackberry was thought to be something you would find in a muffin. The 8800 was the one I was using until I was given the Bold and, up until then, I thought of it as the best Blackberry ever. Then, the Bold came and it is probably safe to state that the Bold is now the last and the best classic Blackberry ever because the Storm, lacking a physical keyboard, probably deserves its own class.When the Bold and the 8800 are placed next to each other, what's striking is the similarities between the 2. The exact same size, similar keyboard, buttons placement, including the now familiar trackball. Even the ports are more or less the same, the same weight. Mine came with its own holster but I could have used the 8800's with the Bold.Then, it's the display. The Bold is what it says it is: bright, clear, vivid. You see it and you now know that it's an evolutionary step up on the ladder. In addition, you get the camera that shoots both pictures and video and the ability to add more memory means that you scan store more video and more music if you want to use your Blackberry as an iPod lite. The operation seems to be a bit faster, the battery life is more or less the same, the quality of the speaker phone is better but, overall, it's your familiar Blackberry, having learned a few new tricks and with a bright face.I am happy with the Bold because I am happy with Blackberries in general. I like the unlimited email and Internet browsing plan, the ability to use Wi-Fi when available and the security it provides. My Blackberry is tied into my company's email environment and it is now very much an extension of my office while I'm away.

B001GJ0E4G,"[2, 4]",4,"Okay--right up front, I'll admit it: I have been a die-hard Palm OS addict since I first purchased one of their (ancient) organizers back in the day. I resisted switching to another brand for a slew of reasons, none of which were all that valid--at least not when I look back on it now. The Palm platform was nothing if not user-friendly...I've said it before: those who designed the Palm OS simply must have assumed it would be used by simpletons who were barely above the deep-thinking of your average Neanderthal. My wife & daughter both have Blackberry Curves, and after playing with them on and off, I further refused to consider anything other than Palm because I couldn't figure it out all that quickly. But things change...but I certainly did NOT want to, I can assure you that.About 6-8 months ago, my Palm 755p began giving me trouble. It wasn't very frequent--at first...but after a few weeks of spontaneous re-starts, some at the most unwanted times, I really began to become annoyed. Working in radio, I did a live broadcast remote at a wireless location and started to seriously consider a Windows Mobile phone (in this case, it was a Moto Q9c). I began to slowly research the Moto Q and Windows Mobile phones in particular on the web and also here at amazon.com. What I discovered was other than a select few, the majority of reviews from Windows users were by and large disappointed with their phones. The common thread wasn't the quality of the phones, but the stability of the Operating System itself.This lead me to consider Blackberry...reluctantly, but a kernal of hope took root and before long, my Treo's problems put me on the fast track to getting a phone that only months before I had vowed never to purchase. I would've loved to get another Palm, but having played with the Centro, I found the keyboard actually TOO small for me to comfortably use--and I don't have big fingers, so I think that says a lot right there. I considered a Windows phone made by Palm, but gave up after reading way too many complaints about the OS screwing up way too much. The upcoming Palm Pre looks VERY promising, but my Treo simply wasn't going to last long enough, so I took the plunge.The Bold is out of the box, striking. It's wider than my Treo but MAN is it thinner by a rather large amount--nearly half I'd say.  The keyboard is quite a bit different in several ways...let me explain: some of the icons and symbols are in entirely different locations than what I had become used to with my Treo 650, 700p and subsequent 755p. I thought it would take FOREVER to get used to that, but surprisingly it didn't at all. Also, the keyboard takes advantage of the wider real estate and is spread out further...but the REAL difference (IMO) is my Palm keys were more individual and separated and way higher than on the Bold. Now THIS took some getting used to. On my Palm it was rather easy, even without looking to move my fingers from one key to the next and simply know from that touch alone that I was on a different key. This is not the case with the Bold keyboard. It bothered me--at first, but after a few days, I have become attuned to the difference and it no longer bothers me like it initially did.The next major change is the screen...and boy is this a mighty HUGE change. First off, I have become rather accustomed to using a touch-screen now for quite some time...it was one of my biggest problems with switching to Blackberry. I briefly considered the Storm, but after playing with the virtual keyboard, I ruled that out entirely. I MUST have a keyboard--the virtual one's just don't cut it for me. The other thing is the 100% Upgrade the screen turned out to be compared with the Treo. I've read about it quite a bit and I gotta tell you, until you see it yourself, words almost cannot do it justice. This screen is unbelievably brilliant. Frickin' incredible. It's a bit wider and a tad shorter than my Palm but the display certainly looked 2 to 3 times brighter and way more clear. Off the charts a MUCH better screen. I have yet to see its equal. I cannot tell you how many times I went--out of habit--to grab the stylus in order to tap it on the screen only to realize my phone no longer has one. I hear rumor that RIM is coming out with a Bold-like phone with a keyboard and touch screen...now THAT will be a phone to look out for...but back to my Bold...I'll be honest, it is quite a change switching to an Operating System so dramatically different than the moronically simple one employed by Palm. Breaking old habits seem to be harder the older I get. Where Palm was intuitive and just plain obvious, Blackberry has been difficult and almost imposible to figure out. I chalk this up to my stubborness more than anything else...but the fact remains: the OS of my Blackberry suffers in comparison to how ridiculously easy Palm phones are to use and figure out. While I am STILL working on getting used to my phone, it DOES have some nifty features NOT found in any Palm device (yet)...for instance, the one thing that sets Blackberry's apart from EVERYTHING else out there is e-mail. This certainly is one place where the Bold not only beats Palm, but embarasses it entirely. The set-up was easy enough that even my Grandma could figure it out and within less than 10 minutes, I had 4 separate e-mail accounts up and running without a hitch. Too easy and it is definitely where the Bold shines (other than the screen).The trackball also takes some getting used to. It's nice that you can adjust the sensitivity of the ball, (much like using a mouse) so if you like to scroll quickly, you can, or if you'd like a bit more control, don't worry, you can do that, too. Another place where the Bold wins hands down is the speaker. It actually has TWO separate speakers which delivers actual stereo sound, quite loudly, I might add. Another really nifty thing if you ask me. It paired up with my Bluetooth quite easily and the sound quality from what those on the other end have told me is noticeably better than on my Palm (which was notorious for having Bluetooth issues).One thing I honestly wish Blackberry did differently is allow the phone to ring and vibrate at the same time. I always figured my wife just couldn't figure it out herself for why her's never did...but as it turns out the phone will vibrate first, and THEN ring. You cannot switch it to do both simultaneously...why, I simply have no clue. The addition of WiFi is a nice added bonus. At work I can surf using the wireless network at my office, also at home and at several friends houses out in the country where service is spotty. Another major advantage over Palm...although in fairness many newer Palms have built-in WiFi...but NONE of the models I have used ever did. 3G service is pretty nice, too...but my Treo 700p and 755p were both EVDO equipped, which are essentially the same thing, so no big difference there. Downloading websites and attachments via email online is a breeze.A couple places where Blackberry can take a cue from Palm (and I realize there aren't that many) are the lack of a switch on the outside that allows you to turn off the ringer instantly without using the screen. I also wish the button to turn on the speaker during a call was situated on the screen and activated via the trackball rather than having to push the tiny $ key on front...it just seems a bit harder to find, even in the dark with the backlight on. A small annoyance, but a valid one all the same.While I have heard many complain about the clarity of the camera, I gotta tell you its WAY better than the measly 1.3 mega-pixel standard on the Palms I've used. I snapped a photo of my little son and sent it to my wife's Blackberry Curve and she wrote back wondering where I had got the photo never once considering it had come from my phone. Sure it'd be nice to have a 3.2 mp camera like on the Storm and 8900, but all in all I am satisfied--especially having come from the inferior Treo camera. The video recorder is noticeably of less quality than the camera is, which strikes me a little odd, but I don't usually videotape much using my phone, so I don't really see that to be a problem for me--but you never know.All in all, I gotta admit--and while it was a LONG time in coming, the Blackberry has won me over. The lack of almost ANY advance in the Palm OS over the course of over 10 years is pretty inexcusable if you ask me. Seriously, my original Palm organizer (no phone) looks relatively unchanged (other than color vs monochrome) from my old Treo 755p. Sure there are a few cosmetic changes in that time, but overall, the OS looks essentially exactly the same as it did from the beginning. That certainly made it easy to figure out when you upgraded over your previous model, but come ON...really? That is much too long to hold onto an outdated OS. The upcoming Pre certainly looks way cool and is an obvious 100% upgrade on the OS, but it just may be a little too late for some--it certainly was for me.If you are a die-hard Palm user frantically becoming disillusioned with your phone, its time to seriously consider moving on and putting the old away in exchange for something enirely new...just be prepared to take a while to get used to it...knowing that alone will make the conversion much easier to handle.Kudos to Blackberry on such a fine product. Conversion complete.*****UPDATE*****I am STILL working on getting used to Blackberry's entirely different Operating System. I find myself continually reaching for a stylus that isn't there, but I am slowly adjusting to a non-touch-screen phone (emphasis on s-l-o-w-l-y).The battery...? Well, let's just say as long as you have WiFi turned off, it's reasonably okay...which is to say on par with my Treo 755p...well, maybe a shade better, but not by much.The trackball...? Surfing on the Web using the trackball is MUCH less efficient than being able to use a stylus (or my finger). I find when I want to scroll down to the bottom of a particularly large page, it can seem like forever having to scroll down so slowly. I wish it were differently--and who knows? Maybe there is a work-around that I am unaware of...The e-mail set up and usage is simply FIRST RATE I have to admit. I haven't bothered to check my e-mail using my computer in several weeks now because I simply don't NEED to. I still send e-mail using my computer because even with the QWERTY keyboard, actually writing a message is still easier using a regular-sized keyboard...but I do find myself not even trying to access e-mail online much...thanks Bold!WiFi IS VERY convenient! The only minor gripe I have is that when I am in an area with less than stellar AT&T; coverage, I turn on WiFi and the phone STILL tries to use the almost non-existent signal to go online. I naturally assumed that the phone would use the strongest signal available, but as it turns out, that isn't the case. Now that I have that figured out, it's simply a case of figuring out where my signal strengths are and remember to turn off and on WiFi and phone receiver. Yes, it IS a bit of a problem, but my Alltel 755p had poor reception where my bedroom is and I was plain SOL if I wanted to check something online--at least NOW I have an option, however inconvenient it may be (I assure you, this is a minor gripe at best).The mp3 player is incredibly easy to use--unfortunately the built-in equalizer isn't all that great and the volume isn't quite what I'd like it to be--but seeing as I have managed to mis-place (lost) my Sansa Clip mp3 player, this is at least a nice alternative that otherwise wasn't available.I downloaded Transformers and Eagle Eye recently and I MUST say, this is yet one more place where the stunning screen simply SHINES beyond the competition. Add to that the fantastic stereo speakers, and watching feature-length movies in the palm of my hand couldn't be more cool & simple.I DO wish the button to turn on the speakerphone was a bit easier to locate and turn on...once again, adding a button to access the speaker ON the screen with the trackball, well that would be a giant leap forward for this device if you ask me.I am still finding it difficult to access a couple of books I downloaded using Mobi Pocket (ie I cannot access them at all), but otherwise, I am still impressed and VERY happy.","04 28, 2009",A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ,"Jeff Edwards ""RadioJeff""",Former Palm user Free @Last with Blackberry conversion,1240876800,RIM Blackberry Bold 9000 (Unlocked) - BLACK

It does not have a tacky feel at all and does not attract lint, but instead has a smooth, almost sensual feel, while still providing a good grip. I need to have my phone on my belt, but it would slide easily in and out of your pocket. It fits the phone perfectly and is tight enough that it has to be pushed on and is a little difficult to get off, so there's no worry about it coming off unless you want it to. It leaves the controls easy to reach and use, but protects them well enough that if you drop it, it would have to land at an angle on the controls to damage them. Not impossible, but it would have to land just right. It is also lined with a velvety material so it won't scratch your phone. I also like that it covers the silver bezel on the front of the phone. I'm sure some prefer to see it, but this case also protects that part. There is another brand that leaves that part exposed if you prefer that. With this case on, it's beautifully black sleek and sexy, like a beautiful woman wearing a little black dress.I haven't had any problems with the clips on the bottom portion, but I've only removed it about 3 times.The holster and Innocase were designed to work together and they do so perfectly. The Innocase clips easily and securely to the holster. It is also quick and easy to release when you want to use the phone. The Innocase goes into the holster with the screen facing the holster, so only the back of the case is exposed and the holster is also lined with the same material as the inside of the Innocase to protect the screen. Also, when you release the phone, it comes out in your hand in the right position for use, without having to maneuver, or turn the phone.I've never had a holster case before because I just didn't trust them, but bought this one based on the reviews and I'm glad I did. I've tried pulling the phone out of the holster and have been unable to get the phone to release from the holster unless I lift the catch.

B001GRRVBC,"[4, 5]",5,"I was a previous Blackberry user and was accustomed to using holsters.  When I purchased my iPhone, my first concern was how to protect it from scratches.  The AT&T; employee was nice enough to install my first screen protector and I proceeded to buy a plastic holster from the ATT&T; store.  After using it a couple of days, I decided to return it as I'm sure the iPhone's back would either be scratched or even cracked without proper protection.  I decided to get a Contour Hybrid silicone/plastic case, which didn't last 2 months.  I wound up spending a week looking for a decent case and maybe even a holster if I could find one.  This lead me to Seidio Innocase II + Holster.  I read the reviews and was very impressed.  This combo was the only holster I found where you place the phone face in and uses a hard slider case.  I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and so far it's holding up pretty well.  The holster is very easy to use and can be operated with one hand.  The phone/case clips into place smoothly and stays clipped in securely.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a hard yet thin case and a perfectly matching holster.The only negative comment I can make has to do with the size of the belt clip.  Be aware that this will work with most narrow belts but will not fit the newer trendy fatter ones.  I was about to purchase a new belt and was glad that I tried the holster before buying it.  Needless to say, I kept my beautiful case and holster.  Oh and the screen protector has to be positioned perfectly.  I may also have to try a different brand.

After my heart started beating again I found out the phone was just fine. Even though the case covers a lot of the buttons and front of the phone everything operates perfectly. Another huge plus is that this case is less than $10 which is a great deal.The only down side is that the phone is hard to get out of your pocket due to the rubber finish. That and after some time the case becomes loose. This covers up the ear piece.

If a product has any small issue, it tends to get under my skin. I initially bought a Proporta case for my new iPhone, and while it looked pretty nice, it wasn't a snug fit, and it was smooth and shallow enough that the phone could easily slip from my grasp, and not have good shock protection. The sides buckled just enough to expose the silver casing at times, which drove me crazy.I almost didn't get the Otterbox because I thought it looked bulky and heavy, but the pictures don't do it justice. It is NICE. It's lightweight, fits snugly, and has plenty of shock protection. I like that it covers up most of the buttons that tend to get smeared when they are exposed. The front of the case is not flush with the screen, which protects it should the phone fall face down. The silicone is smooth and feels really good in the hand, and the nubbly surface and high corners make for a nice, secure grip when you're holding the phone. It's not gonna slip, and if it does, it's well-cushioned when it hits the ground.The hole in the back for the Apple logo bugged me a little, so I cut a small piece off the enclosed screen cover and placed it over the logo before putting on the case. (I bought a pack of Halo Matte Screen protectors along with this so my screen was already covered.) Problem solved--the whole thing looks great and is much less likely to get scratched up.

I opted for the 9100 because of the shape of the display, allowing a better integration and because of the sleek design.In early '09 I had to fight with less performant firmware, but current versions are absolutely flawless and a lot better than most integrated systems I found on well established European brands.Basically this system has it all: Phone over car stereo, blue tooth playback of audio files from any blue tooth enabled device, USB (used for upgrading firmware, but also for charging devices), obsolete (old) Apple connector (can be upgraded to lightning with an adapter).A scenario I totally love is listening to music from my well located Note 3 phone, streamed from &#34;Spotify&#34;, having the navigation screen and if directions are spoken the music is muted and on top of that when a call comes in, that one will have priority over nav and music. As soon as you hang up, the nav/music scenario goes on...Only 4 out of five stars because the display could use a brighter setting besides the &#34;daytime&#34; one. In my convertible roadster I had to move the display to various spots in order to be able to read at open top and direct sunlight.The installation should not take more than one hour if the supplied harness fits your car stereo and about 2 1/2 hours if you need to cut into the car wires. Adapter harnesses for specific car makes are also available, but those will do the same thing as a skilled owner would do by cutting into the car wires.I have not yet seen a factory integrated system which will allow you (as the Parrot does) to listen to music while the navigation is on and on top of that allowing phone calls, but I will agree I haven't seen them all :)","03 23, 2014",A3TGM00ECLUTZG,"Adrian S.

The quality was just ok and it needed to be recharged about once a week which quickly became a pain to the point of it collecting dust.  Well, after local law enforcement ""reminded"" us about cell phone use, it was time to find another solution.This thing is great!  It's hard wired to the car and works very well.  Audio comes out of your car's speakers and the system automatically mutes music during an incoming call.  The mic also picks up very well, including passengers in the back seat.I was surprised at the iPod sound quality.  It sounded better than the aux input on our factory radio.  This is due to the unit having it's own amp which bypasses your radio's amp.  In the case of stock, it's better.  However if you have an aftermarket system, it may sound worse.Pros:1) Mic quality2) Sound quality3) Automatically mutes music4) iPod music sounds even better over a stock system.5) Steering remote works very well.6) Easier installation when using a car specific wiring harness (all plug n play).  In the case of our 2008 Honda Civic we needed a BT-1722-A adapter.  Amazon's recommendation was for the BT-1721-A adapter which is incorrectCons:1) Install may be difficult for some.  If you ever replaced a car radio, this'll be easy, especially with the harness.2) Screen could be brighter in direct sunlight.Note:- Unit came with software version 1.91 as indicated in the advanced settings menu and the white sticker on the blue brainbox.  You can download the latest software to a USB drive from Parrot's website.  Version 1.91 didn't seem to work with an iPad 2 as a music player.  Version 2.02 was available for download which corrected this problem.- For about the same price, you could purchase a new car stereo with built in iPod and BT, Pandora support and a better integrated amplifier than your stock radio.  You already have to remove the stereo to add this product therefore you might as well upgrade to a new headunit.  For example, the JVC KD-R730BT is cheaper than this product and offers much more features.  In our case, we went with Parrot because our Civic has navigation.- The plug n play harness was actually cheaper on _Crutchfield and they included step by step instructions for removing our radio at no extra charge.","06 19, 2012",A12QIKRWLK7VA2,Survi,Better than Visor Mounted BT Speaker,1340064000,Parrot MKi9100 Advanced Bluetooth Hands-Free Music Kit

Because when you stream BT audio you can use your appsPandora, Slacker, etc. But another thing you can use is your navigation apps and the nav will run in the background meaning that you can listed to music and when instructions come it lower the music tells you then turns it back up.

The addition of the ipod and usb drive options are good.What I wish the software would do is when you connect a usb drive, instead of having every artist listed, an alphabet can appear first and then you can select the artist.Every time I start my car, if I want to listen to an artist that starts with the letter N for instance, I have to scroll all the way to that artist starting from A.If playlists or if it had internal memory to remember your last song played was available in this model it would be perfect.

B001LRPN0I,"[0, 0]",5,"First, this item is only good for the original Storm I, so there probably won't be many more of these sold. However, I purchased 2 of them, one for home and another for work. I use them both daily.Prior to purchasing the charger/sync pods I had purchased an extended battery that lasted so long it never came close to running out of juice during the day, no matter what I used my Blackberry for. Unfortunately, the ""door"" for the back of the Storm that was included with the battery was so flimsy that it didn't last very long -- maybe 6 months or so. My only option was to purchase another extended battery (which I didn't need) just to get another flimsy door. I decided instead to reinsert my original (non-extended) battery with original (non-flimsy) door and get the 2 pods for easy recharge.I work in IT so the one at work just sits there at my desk. I keep the one at home on my nightstand by my alarm clock. So now, I keep my Storm easily recharged by inserting the phone into the pods when not in use. And I keep it in ""bedside"" (or ""clock"") mode so I have a nice clock to look at. At home I have a backup alarm (which I was using it for already). I can also activate the photo ""slide"" feature and have my Blackberry display my photos like one of those electronic picture frames. And best of all, the battery stays charged as if I have an extended battery just as conveniently.The only negative is that I must carry an extra charger for the car, but that's not really a fault of the pod, of course.The very nice design and convenience of this pod or dock is well-worth the small cost for the unit. You do have to purchase an additional wall charger for it (one doesn't come with the pod). This is a little inconvenient, but they are fairly easy to find and also super-inexpensive. Just make sure you buy an *actual* charger for the Storm and not a knock-off. I tried the knock-offs and they seemed to mess up the electronics in the Blackberry.","07 10, 2010",A1XBMLUS9TGPIO,C. R.

At first I was not familiar with all the functions and keys but I spent the night figuring everything. Right out of the package I inserted my sim card, battery and the phone fired up right away.Pros:Good size phone with a good solid feel. I especially like the feedback from the screen when you touch or use the stylus which folds neatly into the bottom of the phone. The package includes a transparent cover for protecting the screen. Do not be put of by earlier reviews! It does have all the MMS features found on other phones. I loaded the included software and from LG's site, I was able to download the newest firmware update which speeds up the phone and opens all the features. The latest software is kp500_v10o. Calls sound good and i was able to text, browse and e mail with a few adjustments in the software. There are several web sites out there with configuaration info and there seem to be droves of people who like this phone.......you cant beat the price for what it does and how good it looks.Cons - It should come with more apps but i will remedy that very shortly,this is a minor nuisance. One other thing, LG USA does not have any information nor will they help with the phone even though it bears their name. I could not get help to access the USB driver from them. Thanks to the many ""friends"" in cyber space i was able to find it in short order.I ordered the case, a protective cover and a extra screen protector because i plan on keeping this as long as i did my last phone..........5 years.

I don't like the round prongs power plug, but I had an adapter since I have lived in Shanghai for the past several years. I think the user interface is simply horrible to use.  The various functions are needlessly buried in layers of senseless options.  Try to make a call to a company that says press 1 for English, 2 for Spanish, etc.  You have to press and hold the touch screen area called unlock. Then you have to press another area to get a touch screen numeral pad.  By the time you get to this point, the number you called is asking you if you want to repeat the options. The microprocessor in this phone must be the slowest on earth. Everything is so slow and counterintuitive that I get upset everytime I use it. In text mode, they use the same layout as a digital phone. Why they didn't have the option of a Qwerty keyboard is beyond logic.  So there you are pressing every button once, twice or three times when it could have been a full keyboard layout. It does have the option where it tries to guess the word you are spelling, which is good. The phone is usable, but frustrating to use in my opinion.

B001MRZY3S,"[3, 3]",3,"The LG KP500 is adequate if you are using it primarily for phone calls, email, Web browsing, and text-messaging. However, it does have a few problems/limitations:Touchscreen: This phone uses a resistive touchscreen as opposed to a capacitive touchscreen. The touchscreen isn't very responsive at times, which is a real annoyance. (Capacitive touchscreens, such as those on the iPhone and Blackberry Storm, are more responsive and support multi-touch gestures.)Homescreen: You can only add/remove a predefined set of widgets on the Homescreen: Calendar, Clock/Alarm, Notes, Music Player, Picture Viewer, Social Networking (My Space, Twitter, Facebook), and International Time.Single-Axis Accelerometer: The keyboard doesn't always change to a full QWERTY keyboard when you change the orientation of the phone from vertical to horizontal.Web Browser: Browsing the Web using the built-in Web Browser is a frustrating experience. The links on a page don't load at least half the time when you click on them. The page also takes a while to refresh after it's been scrolled. I downloaded and installed Opera Mini, which works flawlessly.Email: The phone can store only 300 email messages. Once the capacity is reached, you have to delete existing emails from the Inbox in order to retrieve more emails. Deleting emails is a hassle: you have to (1) select and delete emails from the Inbox (deleted emails are then placed in the Deleted folder) and (2) navigate to the Deleted folder and delete the emails again before they are finally expunged.Syncing With Outlook: I am able to sync with Outlook on my PC only through USB, not bluetooth. I get a ""Pairing setting is failed while connecting with the device [sic]"" error message with bluetooth syncing. The To Do list is barely functional -- there is no way to sort it and the subject field is only about 14 characters wide. Calendar and To Do List are limited to 500 items.FM Radio: The FM Radio only works with the earbuds (included) plugged in. The earbuds use a proprietary LG connector, not a standard 3.5mm audio plug. The sound from the earbuds is tinny.Camera & Video: The camera has no autofocus, much less zoom capability. The camera is best used for close-up shots (distant objects are blurry). The video is very choppy because of the low frame rate (12 fps).---There you have it.

So, when I took a trip to Germany and found the LG KP500 there, I was quite curious. I looked up reviews here on Amazon, and after some consideration, bought the phone from a German electronics retailer... And I am sure glad that I did!Let's get started with the Pros and the Cons of this phone.PROS:-Unlocked, Quadband World Phone.-Inexpensive. I bought the phone for 89, which is comparable to the price here on Amazon.-Good Quality. Although the phone is small and made of plastic, it has an extremely durable feel.-Signal Quality. I normally have no signal with T-Mobile's To-Go plan in my house, but I usually have at least 3 bars with this phone. By comparison, my last three phones constantly lost signal in my house.-Great features. Many features, including a Movie editor, 3MP Camera, Music Player, Video Recorder, Games, Accelerometer, and drawing pad.-Stylus. Not really necessary, but it really helps with texting and making notes.-Multiple Apps and Task Manager. You can run more than one app at a time, like Music Player and Camera-Widgets. On the home page, there is a selection of widgets to choose from. These include: Music Player, World Clock, Clock, Calender, FM Radio, and Notepad.-Speed Dial Widgets. With a swipe of the finger, the home page changes to a speed dial home page with up to 10 contacts and images.-Downloadable Apps and Games. The phone is Java based, so you can download .JAR apps from a number of sites to transfer to the phone.-Expandable Memory via microSD slot (Up to 8gb)CONS:-The interface, while very sleek and refined, can become slow due to multiple apps running at once.-Texting in QWERTY format is a bet annoying at first, due to the small keyboard. But after a while, you get used to it.My recommendation: If you are looking for a new, unlocked phone at a cheap price, the LG KP500 is for you.NOTE: I own the silver version of this phone, which doesn't have the rubbery texture.UPDATE 10/2010-The phone is still working great. I actually received an update from T-Mobile to allow MMS messaging and internet web-browsing, so the phone is actually better now than it was 6 months ago!

I had the same experience as others here getting only one channel to work on the headphones when using this device (and I bought another item at Radio Shack with same results).

Bought this because my original C-S2 battery and a backup of the same were failing.The original that came with the phone is listed at 1150mAh, and is supposed to have a talk time of three hours, with a standby time of 1 days. When my talk time had hit under an hour and standby time was less than a day, it was time to replace it. Since the BlackBerry C-S2 battery has a cryptographic chip to ensure you're using the right one for the particular BlackBerry smartphone you have, it should either work or be a dud.And when I received this battery, it was a dud.But going back to the original documentation for these, the BlackBerry C-S2 battery requires a full 8-hour or longer charge before it can be used, so I charged this one. That did the trick... to some degree.This replacement has never been quite up to the talk time of the original when it was new, but at about 2 hours, it wasn't worth sending back, so I've kept it. This one is better than another that I picked up here from another vendor, so it was better to hold onto one that worked as opposed to one that didn't.Your experiences may be different, and from some of the reviews posted here, that seems to be the case. If I planned on keeping my 9330 Curve for a few more years, I might have complained, but there are other smartphones that get better life (and performance) today, so this one is at least a solution that keeps it going for now.If you get one of theseBlackberry Standard Lithium-ion Replacement Battery C-S2packs here, my only suggestion is that you charge it for 8-12 hours before you use it.

B001UC9NOQ,"[178, 179]",5,"This is a generic 'Type A to Micro B' USB cable and it's in no way Blackberry specific but, YES, it WILL work with a BB Bold or Storm. I needed one of these to connect one camera to the computer because I lost the original when someone 'found' my camera case. It works.On this specific cable, everything is done right, including the price. It is USB 2.0 certified, meaning that it supports data transfer rates of up to 480Mbps and, if your device accepts a Micro-B plug, this is the cable to get. Maybe the 2-meter length (6+ ft.) is a little bit too much but it does not bother me a lot and there may come a time when a cable this long may come in handy.I am awarding this item 5 stars for price, quality and, especially, for the very good presentation on Amazon's page.______________________________________________Notes:Anyone in the market for a USB cable should be very careful because there are at least 6 kinds of USB connectors. If you are buying a cable that connects 'something' to your computer or laptop, the computer end of the cable will always be a USB-A or 'Type A' connector. At the other end, you may have a USB-B/Type B - a nearly square shaped connector used mostly to deliver power to a device but this is rare. Most likely, you will have a Mini-B or a Micro-B. The difference between the 2 is that the Micro-B is half as thick while the width is the same - Mini-B is 3x7mm while Micro-B is 1.5x7mm.If your device (phone, PDA, camera) is a 'new' one and it's using USB, chances are that they will need a Micro-B connector because the industry seems to be adopting the 'Micro' form factor as its standard. If the above sounds simple, you should keep in mind that some devices require Mini-AB or Micro-AB connectors, also known as USB OTG (OnTheGo) devices.My advice: before ordering any cable, make sure that you clearly understand what type of cable you need. This Amazon listing and most Cables Unlimited listings are most helpful because the Amazon page gives you a visual of what the connectors look like. Whenever in doubt, do some more research.","11 17, 2009",ADLVFFE4VBT8,"A.

On a Samsung Intercept, you'll notice that the micro usb area on the phone is covered by what seems like a flimsy tied on piece of rubber that folds down flat when not using the plug.  When you try to push the micro usb charger or sync plug into the phone, it is a very tight fit and really can't be done (by me) in full dark.  I always have to use a separate light source to accomplish my goal, but I risk waking up my hubby when I do that.  Also, it has a short cord, which is great if you don't need a long one.

I'm not going to use it as a data sync cable, but only as a back-up charger, and it works perfectly so far.  It's a bit of a thinner gauge compared to the original OEM cable that came with my phone, but at the same time is much more flexible and pliable.  It is NOT BlackBerry branded (but wasn't expected to be based on the description), and is quite a bit shorter than described.  Amazon states 3.9 feet.  I don't have a tape measure with me, but placed side by side with the OEM cable, it's about 18 inches shorter.  No problem for me.  That actually works out better because I only need maybe 2 feet to charge my phone at work.  If you're looking for a longer cable, you might want to look into a different one though.

I said in a review of those that I was going to try the Jaybird's, but I liked the S9's so much that I decided to try the S9 HD's instead.  I had read that the S9 HD's were much improved in sweat resistance.  Not true.On the positive, I will say there is no comparison between the S9's and the S9 HD's as far as sound quality.  The HD's simply blow the older model away.  I was very happy with them initially, although I was so paranoid after my earlier short lived experience, that I found myself CONSTANTLY wiping the headphones off to make sure they didn't get wet while working out.  Well, even that didn't work.  Sadly after only 3 workouts, these too have failed.  This time the headphones themselves still function, as well as the volume controls, however the pause, phone, and forward/back controls have all failed.  Sigh...I really do want to like these headphones, but they are obviously not an appropriate product if you want to use them for workouts.  At least they had the decency to fail within the 30 day return period!This time I actually did order the Jaybirds instead.  I know they don't have the same audio quality as these do, but hopefully they will function for over a week!UPDATE:  I looked at my review this morning, and decided that I was too harsh in rating these 1 star (although I can't go back and change that).  They really are very good as far as sound quality, and if you aren't using them for workouts, then you will probably really like them.

I finally started using these again hoping I could cope with the worst bluetooth range I have ever seen to date, and sorry, I can't take it.Pros:The sound quality is great. It's some of the best I've ever had for Bluetooth Headphones.I haven't had sweat problems at the gym like other people seem to have had.They are very lightweight, although it would be nicer if it was lower so you could lay down with them on.Cons:The rubber glue holding the power button rubber unglued itself.The battery life is about 5 hours... not bad for the size, but not really that great either.Motorola technical support is some of the worst ever conceived, it's a joke to even call it that.They bend pretty easy - if you take these on a road trip, make sure they don't have /any/ weight on them. Mine bent to the left pretty heavy and took some time to bend back.But the real meat and potatoes is that THESE HAVE THE WORST WIRELESS RANGE IN THE HISTORY OF WIRELESS.I have to put my phone in my hood to get the sound to not cut out nonstop. Pockets? Sorry, you are SOL. Like working out? It works, kind of. Biking with your phone in your pocket is a long lost dream. I didn't buy these - My HT820 (which by the way was AMAZING compared to these) went in for warranty, and they sent me these back. No charger, no manual, nothing but these in a box (and they weren't even bubble wrapped!) and then when I contacted them about it, they said my warranty had expired. That might be due to the fact that it TOOK NEARLY 3 WEEKS to get a response. Getting an RMA on my previous set so bad that I am never buying Motorola again.Overall, I really dislike these headphones because there is no practical use.

B001YSI04A,"[1, 1]",5,"I am a runner and have been using these headphones for the past four years with different devices on the treadmill in the gym as well as outdoors. Currently I use them with my iPhone 4S, with which this headset paired effortlessly. However I am now on my third headset.After about a year the battery did not seem to be holding a charge, and I got a replacement headset. I see from other reviews that other people have also had some battery issues, though I have no idea how widespread that is.Soon after getting that replacement I started going to a gym where the treadmill area was not well ventilated and tended to be humid. I got drenched in sweat and so did the headset. The volume control stopped working (it was stuck on the highest volume) and there was static coming out of one of the ear buds. Fortunately it was not too late to get another free replacement from the store where I purchased them.I note that all electronic items can be ""zapped"" by moisture unless they are specifically designed to be water resistant. It appears that this headset is not. It never was an issue for me until I started running indoors at my first gym. I have since switched gyms, and my new gym is well ventilated. I also wear the Buff (which I have reviewed on Amazon) when I run. Since this covers my entire head and is great for absorbing sweat, including sweat on the back of my neck, the sweat is no longer an issue for me.Note: If you want a corded headset to use when sweat will be an issue, I suggest the Sennheiser PMX 70, which I have reviewed on Amazon.In any event, my latest headset has been working just fine for the past three years.Before purchasing this headset, you should keep some things in mind.First, depending on what device you use, it may be necessary to buy a separate blue tooth adapter (I had to do that when I used this headset with an iPod).Second, if you wear glasses, it works best to put the headset on first and the glasses on second. The glasses won't fit quite as snugly as they normally do, but for exercise it will be fine. I found that if I put my sunglasses on first, the headset did not fit as snugly in my ears, with a resulting loss in sound. The same thing applies if you wear a headband or bandana--put the headset on first.Third, since the headset is curved in the back, if you wear anything with a collar that sticks up in the back, the collar will push against the headset, which will come slightly out of its position in your ears. So wearing the headset with a ski jacket won't work very well. With a thinner collar, you will occasionally have to reposition the headset as the collar pushes against it. Also, if you wear a ski hat to run, you will not be able to pull it down over your ears.Fourth, because of the back of the neck design, you will not be able to use this headset comfortably to lay on your back (like on a blanket at the beach, a couch in your den, a chaise lounge by the pool) or to sit in a reclining position with your head back (like in a car or airplane). Likewise you will need to remove it to use certain equipment at the gym, like the situp bench.All in all I am very satisfied with this product now that I have resolved the sweat issue.Update March 17, 2012: I figured out how to use this headset comfortably to lay on my back. Turn the headset upside down (So the M now looks like a W), put it in back of your head, and put the earbuds into your ears without looping anything over your hears like you usually do. The back of the headset will now be flush against your neck, and you can comfortably lay back on a beach chair etc. Keep in mind that now the phone button and volume controls will be on your right ear instead of your left ear. I can't believe that I didn't think of this sooner.","01 24, 2012",A3NEAETOSXDBOM,Stephen M. Charme,Great for running and gym workouts,1327363200,Motorola MOTOROKR Bluetooth Stereo Headphones

As a voice and text phone, it functions quite well.  However the internet and ""smartphone"" features are pretty weak.The default browser on the phone is just ""ok"", but doesn't support the necessary security protocols to be able to access my webmail.  It also has a bunch of super annoying ""locked"" bookmarks, which you can't modify or remove.  I bought the darned phone, shouldn't I at least be able to set up bookmarks in my own browser?  Regardless, what I would highly recommend doing is installing Opera Mini (works great) and using that instead of the default browser.  My webmail works like a charm on that.Along the same lines, there are a bunch of paid services (GPS, weather, games) which are *locked* within the menus.  The phone will allow you to remove the free services if you like, but the ones are subscription based cannot be modified.  It's as if they are saying ""pleeeeaassee buy this service"".  One time I accidentally activated AT&T; navigator by forgetting to lock the phone when I put it in my pocket.  Of course there was no way to opt-out through the phone, so I had to call AT&T; to get it taken care of.Physically the phone is built well, with a robust slide out keyboard.  It really snaps in and out of place very firmly and feel substantial.  After one year it's just as structurally sound as it was on day one - and yes I've dropped it a couple times.  Like most phones, the shiny front and plastic backing will become scratched over time.  Reception is generally good and dropped calls are rare.So overall this is a nice phone, but I wouldn't qualify it as a ""smartphone"".

I had a Jabra JX10 Bluetooth earpiece from years back but found that it was not loud enough to compete with the enhanced exhaust and 13""-wide rear tires of my sports car.  Having been pleased with Jabra in the past, I naturally looked at their offerings first and decided upon the very reasonably priced SP200.The unit was as easy to pair with my phone (a Palm Pre) as any other Bluetooth headset and the volume is so loud that I can hear everyone just fine even if I'm roaring down the highway.  The noise canceling works so well that people often don't know I'm on Bluetooth and they never know that I'm in my loud sports car.  It's that good.A single charge lasts me several weeks (I don't talk that often while driving) and when it does get low, the handy LED reminder triggers me to drag it into my office with me and I simply attach it to the USB port on my computer (cable included) and let it charge for a couple of hours and I'm good to go again.Things I like about this headset:1) just tap the button and it wakes up from sleep mode and locks onto my phone2) have it paired with my wife's phone too (it can remember multiple phones)3) I don't have to turn it off- it magically goes to sleep after I've been away from the vehicle for awhile (15 minutes?)4) again, volume is ridiculously loud if you want it to be5) excellent clarity of my voice and their voice6) fairly stealthy up on the sunvisor- you forget it's there7) it's portable: sometimes I bring it in the house for conference calls8) crazy cheap for this level of qualityThings I don't like:1) I wish I didn't have to push anything to turn it on/wake it up.  Though I'm sure such a feature would be murderous on battery life.2) voice dial like my wife's car has would be awesome.  I think if I had a better phone, it could maybe use the phone's voice dial capability.  Sadly, I bought the godawful Palm Pre (never again).","04 4, 2010",A2OS3TIVAKUAHG,J.

B00276S55M,"[1, 2]",3,"I was very disappointed as I opened the package for this product.  There is very limited protection as the sides are completely open.  If you are looking for just protecting your screen, then this will work.  It will not stop anything from finding its way into the open sides.There is a very easy to use attachment screw that fastens into the tripod port on the bottom of the camera.  Once attached, you simply wrap the camera with the material and a velcro patch holds it in place.I have a small camera (FujiFilm EXR) and this wrap barely fits this camera.  The velcro has very little to attach itself to and if I do not stretch the material and wrap it extremely tight, then the velcro detaches.  Once when this happened, my camera fell out of my hands and onto the desk - if I was standing, the camera might have fallen to the floor.  There is no room to hold anything else in this wrap - this is not a substitute for a camera case to hold extra batteries, memory cards, or the charger.  The product description says that this product lends itself to easy removal of the battery and memory cards.  On my camera this is not true:  I would have to remove the entire wrap to get into the battery/memory card compartment.I take pictures everywhere I go and this product just gets in the way.  I generally carry the camera in my pants pocket and this would just add bulk.  I would still have to keep a small case handy for the other above mentioned accessories.I guess, I'm the minority so far, but I just don't see that this accomplishes anything and it adds a level of complication.","11 24, 2009",A26KHZE0HTS057,Burgmicester,Dissenting view - not for everyone,1259020800,Lowepro D-Wrap for Digital Camera (Black)

I can access my battery and memory chip in my camera with ease as the wrap is attached to the tripod mount.  For cameras with the tripod mount on the same side as the battery/memory chip opening, it might be more of a hassle to move aroound in.Ideally, this wrap would be perfect for slim point-and-shoot cameras with a width of less than an inch.

With this case, I can get my camera out of its protective cover, use the camera, and put it back in the case all one-handed.Like I wrote above, this is my second LowePro case--the other one has zippers and pockets with space for the bare essentials--and only reinforces my recommendation for this brand of case exclusively.

B00276S55M,"[0, 2]",2,"When I saw that Vine was offering Lowepro D-Wrap, I jumped on it because I own several point-and-shoot cameras.  This camera wrap asserts that it fits (or stretches to fit) most cameras.  Unfortunately, that does not include my Canon A630 PowerShot.While the wrap stretches, it would require three strong men to stretch it around my Canon.  So, even though it screwed into the tripod mount as advertised, it would mean more effort to get it into place than I could give it.Giving up on my Canon, I tried it on my Flip video camera.  Yes, it folds over and protects it nicely, unless, that is, you screw it into the tripod mount.  At that point, it become impossible to stretch it over the entire camera because at that point the camera is vertical and too tall to fit.Finally, I tried it on my mother's Kodak SureShot.  Voila! It fits (with a moderate amount of stretching).  It's open at the ends, so the camera is still subject to foreign objects entering from the side, but it does protect the lens and viewing screen from dust and other undesirables while the camera is in purse or pocket.By the way, if you carry your camera in your pocket, you'll probably want to have a large pocket because the neoprene does not slide around easily in a close space and will not slip down into a tight jeans pocket.So would I recommend this camera glove?  It depends.  It depends on the size of your point-and-shoot camera.  It depends on how often you use your camera and whether you've already got camera protection. Those who already have a case they use will probably not benefit from this D-wrap.","11 28, 2009",A240FRPD4MEXND,Phyllis Staff,"A Nice, Stretchy Camera Glove That Doesn't Fit My Camera",1259366400,Lowepro D-Wrap for Digital Camera (Black)
B00276S55M,"[0, 0]",4,"This is a unique camera case.  Instead of being separate, it becomes ""part of it"" by attaching to it.  It does this by attaching to the tripod hole, and stretches across the body of the camera.  The sides aren't protected, but it seems to be okay for most purposes.  Unstrapping the case, will allow it to fold down, allowing you to use the camera, and the thing remains hanging from it...no need to put away or find your case again.  It's different and I like the idea, but I really want the protection from a normal case that won't allow as much dirt/dust in.  It's not bad, and it serves it's purpose well enough.  I could see this being a good choice for those who aren't too picky about these things.","12 28, 2009",A2L4XGVPR42KHL,"Therabbitssing ""on the rock that spews lava..""",A unique case but not for me.,1261958400,Lowepro D-Wrap for Digital Camera (Black)
